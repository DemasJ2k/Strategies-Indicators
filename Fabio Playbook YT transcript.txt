00:00:00	This guy is the best scalper in the world for the 
first time ever where he showcases the power of his strategy and breaks it down step by step. 
Freemon. You wait for this candle. You put the stop loss here. You target either. This is the 
main reason why a lot of traders use money. They try to anticipate what the market is doing 
before the market does it. People call this manipulation. They try to break out and they 
fail. This is the reason we will get here. You finally will see a trader break 
down candle by candle exactly what he 

00:00:29	thinks is going to happen live during New York 
session. We are getting ready for the squeeze. The squeeze will be present here. Look, there 
you have it. When I told you I will scale out, it's exactly because when you see this, 
the next step is aggressive sellers. Yeah, you you coded the algorithm. This is a top 1% 
trader showcasing his strategy for free to give to the audience a little bit of reference. 
You can either do 15 minutes, 3 minutes, you can do 1 hour 5 minutes or you can do the most 
aggressive one. That is what I do. The setup that 

00:01:04	we took before is exactly what I will execute in 
the world trading cup. How I did this performance in the world trading cup is building profit for 
the day, building profit for the day, building profit for the day. And in directional days, I 
risk for example, Fabio Valentino. You've never seen anything like it. It will blow you away. 
Make sure you tune in to this episode of Chart Fanatics. Welcome everyone back to Chart Fanatics, 
the go-to channel for all of the very best trading strategies and concept breakdowns with the very 
best traders in the world. Talking of which, today 

00:01:34	we have a worldclass scalper with us, a future 
scalper at that. He has been in the top three in the world rankings of the Robins Club, actually 
achieving in a 12-month period over 500% return. And that is in the futures division as well. You 
probably already know who it is. If you don't know, you're going to get to know. We're going to 
go through his exact strategy that he used to be able to achieve those incredible results on the 
world stage. is the one and only Fabia Valentina. Thank you for asking me Ritz. And uh today we 
will go deep dive in the model that I used in 

00:02:10	the world champion. I made some videos about it 
but I keep the source for this this podcast and um before starting to explain how the model works 
we need to explain what's the misconception about market structure in the market. So I will 
just start drawing it and explain what 90% of traders do and why 90% of traders lose money. 
So let's start with I think that'll be helpful. The concept of the market structure that's what 
usually a lot of traders do and you can confirm it. This is what usually it's done uh watching a 
market structure shift or change of character or 

00:02:54	breakout. There are 100 terms that you can use 
for it. And uh what they try to do is they try to go trend following when pattern like this 
presents and then they can just wait for the uh retracement to jump in just going through 
considering we are in a short sentiment here like using the concept of supply or order block 
if you want to be more fancy following the algo uh mitigation level and continue to go down. Now 
what I tested in a lot of years of experience is that this pattern usually doesn't work if you 
don't frame it in the correct uh concept and 

00:03:35	to frame it in the correct concept you need 
to start using something that is necessary that is the profile. So you need to understand 
exactly where you are in the market and what's the big picture that you are watching because if 
this pattern is presented when the bell curve of the distribution of the day is like this you are 
exactly jumping on a trend to go against the lower distribution of the volume. M and what this says 
statistically is that only 30% will go through the rest will remain in what it's called the fair 
value area. So you will just keep getting stopped 

00:04:25	out till the market really uh decide to take off. 
And this is the reason a lot of traders that try to embark on a journey of using trend following 
strategies they understand really soon that uh the win rate is not what they were expecting 
like 70 80%. when they try to target for example this level from here and they say okay I will just 
have 50% 60% we rate 1 to three this is not real because you are not you are not reading what the 
market is saying you are trying to predict the market okay now the good point about order flow 
and about volume analysis in general is that you 

00:05:07	get the knowledge to understand when to stay 
away because if the same pattern is presented in this area it's a completely different situation 
to explain you this we need to go to AMT AMT is uh the real nature of the market and is the 
concept of auction market theory market is an auction and it goes from balanced area where all 
market participants are transactioning efficiently to imbalance Now market is not usually in in 
imbalance. It's usually in balance. So that's the reason why traders that start take you streak 
of stop-loss because they try to get the long and 

00:05:57	they get liquidated by you can call what you want. 
You can call spring, you can call liquidation, you can call uh liquidity seeking everything 
you want even if it's not what happens behind the curtains but you try to get the last spring. 
M before the move up and you notice that this 1 to 10 becomes a 1 to2 because you take four stop 
to try to do it. Yeah. Now if you do this simple change and you wait for the market to get to a 
condition of out of balance your win rate will jump up by at least 20 to 30%. And this is exactly 
the building point of the model that I use. Why I 

00:06:36	call it a model and not a strategy? Because the 
concept of strategy is a group of rules that you need to follow strictly. And how can you follow 
a group of rules strictly without understanding the narrative if the market is a dynamic entity? 
It's like trying to cage an animal that is not made to be in a cage. And it change every day. 
It adapts. For example, yesterday there was this situation about America bombing Iran. we open 
with a gap down really heavy. You cannot expect that the market today will behave as Friday. 
You will have a different behavior. Now what 

00:07:11	it's helping you is understanding how you can use 
the profile to exactly time your entry and your area. So this is the step one of the model and 
is understanding the location. The location is when you can efficiently trade when you are out 
of balance. So your model is okay to be traded. You start to see what all the traders are using. 
So you start to see the market structure and you start to validate which area can be used to jump 
on trade. Yeah. Okay. So now it comes handy to use supply and demand zones and it comes handy to 
understand inefficiency. Now inefficiency if we 

00:07:59	can talk about it uh is misconcepted. nowadays 
because it used the term fair value gap. Yeah. But what happened really behind the curtains in 
uh the concept of inefficiency is when one part is more aggressive than the other. So the market 
gets really momentum in one direction and this is if you think about it is the best moment to 
transact because the market is telling you this and this is not my personal opinion or your 
personal opinion. What the market is telling us look I'm out of balance. Mhm. I'm searching 
for a new level of balance that will be down. 

00:08:35	So it it can be here, it can be here, it can be 
here, but I'm telling you that I will go there. Okay. At the same time is telling you that 
the sellers are more aggressive than buyers because you are getting this kind of concept. 
And that's when you go to step two. Step two is the concept of validating the level. 
Mhm. Because now you have the direction, you have the condition of the market, the market 
status and you have three possible takeprofit that you can frame by watching at the other area. Now 
it comes handy a concept called order flow that 

00:09:11	is not a concept but it's like an alphabet a 
new way of reading the market. So 90% of the trader try to understand what is happening inside 
a candle using multi-time frame analysis. Yeah, I think the real inefficiency is the way trader 
analyze the market because it's like trying to get the bullseye Mhm. blinded. Mhm. Like maybe 
one time it will work, two times it will work, but you don't have exact data about the location. 
Yeah. So what you can do is that you can use this area that create the breakouts and let's consider 
that I make an arrow here and we zoom out. 

00:09:52	what is happening exactly inside here. Okay. 
So if this is the swing point that break this low traders will just watch for what is called 
fair value gap or inefficiency that is when the candle is not transaction efficiently. What you 
can do is that you can use from point A to point B using profile to watch exactly when there are 
low volume node. Yes. And I know this because I saw the other interview that you have made and 
I really like the model also of Carmen Rosato. I think he's a really good order flow trader and 
is doing something really similar to what am I 

00:10:32	doing because low volume node it's a really 
good reaction level. So you can use it as a continuation. If we have a low volume node here 
the probability that we will go down is really high. Yeah. So you start to add the concept 
of refinement. Mhm. You have the direction, you have the location, you have the refinement 
of the location. Now you need the step three. The step three is a little bit more difficult 
because it's the part where you really need the experience and you cannot just automate it and 
say okay when it's happening because it's really 

00:11:10	sensitive to market. What I use is analyzing big 
orders. So when there is in one specific point let's say here a lot of aggression. Mhm. Okay. 
And in order flow platform typically you see bubbles. Yeah. Okay. If you use any platform you 
can see bubbles. When there is direction location and aggression your ability to predict is zero 
but your ability to read is 100. You are exactly tuning in in the market at the correct moment 
and you are not predicting what is going to do. You are waiting. So this is really beneficial 
because when you see aggression you don't have 

00:11:56	a huge stop loss for example out of balance. You 
don't have a huge stop loss above the high but you can get protected exactly above the big sell 
aggression. Yeah. So your risk-to-reward rate it's really big but at the same time the probability 
of your trades is really really big also this one what you are doing if we can make an example is 
just swimming on the direction of the flow. Yeah because you are being pulled down by the market 
aggression and also by all the traders that were long and when this area breaks will close 
their position. So you get the catalyst down, 

00:12:34	you get the location of the aggression of the 
cell and you get also the target point that can be based. We will see this on chart directly on 
the previous balance area. Yeah, because how the market moves. Let's remove this part here. But how 
the market moves is that is seeking balance. Mhm. So if you go out of here and the previous balance 
area was this one where your P point of control, the previous point where the majority of the 
volume was located, it's here. The probability that when you go this pattern and you enter here, 
let's say, you don't need to break your mind 

00:13:17	to understand where you can put your target. 
Maybe I can try 1 to 30. And this is another error. Traders think that the risk to reward is 
not influencing we rate. The more you seek to go above the AT daily, the more the probability will 
get lower. Hey guys, I hope you're enjoying this episode so far. And don't forget, we send every

00:15:48	today. Now, let's get back to the episode. So, 
with this model, it's really uncommon that the market will snap back inside because when you see 
aggression and out of balance, the market needs to search for new balance. It's like human 
being. When we are in a condition of fear, our heart continue to have takia till we don't 
get back to calm. Yeah. And we say okay now we are stable. Okay. This is exactly what the market is 
doing. So the step three is getting a location for aggression. So that the trigger of the uh model is 
aggression and that target point. The target point 

00:16:27	also is really objective and I noticed during 
this year and also scalping during the um world cup champion that we can also get a window during 
the day where this model works really good. Yeah. Okay. So the best session to use this model it's 
100% New York session specifically for equities. So for NASDAQ and uh for uh yes and uh is not 
working properly during the first hour of London session. I try to use this model and during London 
session you see out of balance back inside balance out of balance back inside balance. This is called 
by traders fake outs. Yeah. And it's usually when 

00:17:11	the market is not um really clear about direction. 
So um one concept that I use to remove this is that I don't trade before New York session. I only 
trade before New York session in the world cup but with a mean reverting model. Okay. So I was doing 
the opposite and we can go also through it because it's extremely profitable and it's even easier 
to implement this one and the following one. So let's say that in a balanced market from 
the statistical perspective during the London session usually in indices you have mean reverting 
behavior. Okay. So it's less common that you will 

00:17:56	see a trend. Yeah. You will see bouncing and going 
out. So one other model that I uh am using is the one that takes opportunity of when the market is 
deep discount based on the volume distribution and misnaps back in. Now it's the same concept. 
It's the opposite. Now we are seeking for buy. We have a target. Why we are using this target? 
Because this target is where the maximum volume volume is transacted. So there is interest like 
market operators are willing to transact here. Mhm. What I do in this area is that I don't 
take the first movement. I wait I wait for the 

00:18:38	first breakout. You can use price action for this 
because I get clear market participants of what they want to do. I don't risk that this is only a 
retracement and then they collapse. Exactly. Yeah, I get a movement that is clear when I get the 
first breakout and I'm back inside the balance. This probability is really high. Mhm. This really 
high probability. Now to increase even more the probability, I wait for the hand of the big market 
participants. So I wait for big trades. Yeah. So the common bubble of buy order that I can just 
say, okay, I jump in with them. I don't need to 

00:19:20	be a wizard. I jump in when the best one are 
jumping in with big volume and if I'm wrong, I want to be wrong immediately. Okay. Yeah. 
Because all the additional losing that you get when you are inexperienced trader and say maybe I 
put the stop loss larger when the market is going against you because I will it will snap back. This 
is really something that will destroy your bank account and your trading account. What you need to 
do is be wrong immediately and when you are right when you see that you get an additional breakout 
immediately stop to break even. Yeah. So after 

00:19:58	this small movement you are already risk free on 
you quite aggressive with your risk management. I'm aggressive with my risk management because I 
need to put in this small amount of ticks. Mhm. 0.25% of my account or 0.5% on the account. So you 
say you could do this or take this concept without order flow for example but of course the order 
flow just allows you to have more confirmation align more with the larger orders. It's working 
also for price action but it's like something that when you see it you cannot unsee it. So um when 
you are trading your mind as an orderflow trader 

00:20:38	says okay price action is nice but let's see what 
is happening in the level. you want to see it and then I think it's not convenient nowadays to 
not use orderflow for one simple reason we are edge and edge seekers as traders every 5% more 
win rate brings us more money at the end of the month every one hour two hour three hour more 
at the end of the month is more money for us so why not using all the information available I've 
been in trading floor I seen how they trade and institutional trader considering that 90% is 
algo trading nowadays. But the discretionary 

00:21:17	trading for alternative markets, they still use 
orderflow. They use orderflow because they want to see what they are doing. Maybe they are more 
long-term because they work with huge amount of capital. So they prefer to use volume profile. 
But for short term, after 10 years of trading, I never seen something better than order flow. So 
still nowadays the model is not getting changed. The only change that I've made is uh during high 
compression period that we have seen in 2023 and 24 the the month that you are going through 
summer like end of March. Yeah. May June you see 

00:21:55	the market is getting a little bit compressed and 
August like NASDAQ movement are really choppy. So um what you can do is just say to create 
specific condition where you will not transact. So this model it's okay for London 
session, it's not okay for New York session, but it's perfect for the summer. So I'm giving you 
a model that it's perfect for the months that we are going in because this is the behavior maybe 
with Iran and America and Israel, it will not be the summer to do this model. But um but yes it's 
working uh properly. But to your point in terms of 

00:22:32	orderflow wise regardless of you know conditions 
that understanding of order flow remains right. So in terms of the principles that you're using when 
using orderflow and understanding that information and deciphering that information regardless of 
the conditions whether we're compressed or whether we're getting a lot of volatility and movement 
the the lessons and principles you take from order flow remains universal. So outside of because with 
price action and purely price action, the problem is one, you're guessing, right? You're trying 
to guess where stops are. You're trying to guess 

00:23:02	where the big players are because you can't see 
it. But equally, when conditions change, the same concepts aren't universal. Now you have to change 
and and be able to adapt. While with the order flow, you still have to adapt. you know, you still 
have to change in terms of your maybe your risk management, your trade management, but the order 
flow itself, like those orders are still orders, those stop losses, those those uh participants are 
still going to be the same. Um, but just a quick question for yourself. You weren't were you always 
an orderflow trader or is it something you picked 

00:23:34	up? No, I was a free action trader, but I'm really 
open-minded. So if someone comes to me and say, "Fabio, you can improve your risk-to-reward 
from here to here using option flow." Yeah, I'm really open to it. Like I think that a trader 
needs to be the most open-minded person because if a new tools for example, if new data like MBO 
orders can improve your model, you shouldn't be you shouldn't put your ego here and say no, my 
model is the best one. if it's improving your profit factor and sharp ratio just use it and 
connecting to your point I went to order flow 

00:24:09	also also because the price action it's harder to 
replicate for students because let's say that we have 100 people watching this okay and we say okay 
use a break of structure in favor of the trend for someone a break of structure is this for someone 
can be external breakoff structure for someone they take the big swing and is this the breakoff 
structure? Okay, if I say to you look drop for the full day the profile the profile is this one. This 
is the level where you are out of balance is not it cannot be this it cannot be this it cannot be 
this. If I say to you it's when you go here just 

00:24:51	put a filter of 30 contracts on NASDAQ on the one 
minute you cannot think it's here because you will see the ball. So it's really objective. Now there 
is a skill in reading of course market sentiment, market change. But when I explain you something, 
it's something that you can go home test it and you will see exactly what I'm seeing with price 
action. I think the the subjective analysis is really heavy especially if you start doing puts 
multi-time frame. So definitely yeah from daily to H4 to H1 to 15 minutes, 3 minutes, 1 minutes. 
What's the probability that the trade that you 

00:25:29	frame is the same that the trade that your 
student will frame? It's really low. That's what I was going to say. So when it comes to say 
teaching for example when there is no orderflow that subjectiveness becomes quite a difficulty 
because everyone has a different perception as you said as you you know there's a really good 
example of of showing that. But then when you have order flow regardless of that the time frame 
potentially and you know where you're looking that the areas on the charts are all going to be the 
same. Everyone's going to see the same thing. 

00:25:56	And those numbers are going to be reflected 
exactly the same across the board to every single person. While you know even the subjectiveness of 
say just candlesticks like a large red candle to one person might just another candle while to 
another person they'll be like oh my goodness the market is completely falling off a cliff when 
they explain the model when you see a big candle how much it's a big candle how much ATR you you 
include. So there is a lot of subjectivity and also let's consider that we have three level of 
analysis. We have lagging, we have real time and 

00:26:33	we are leading. Lagging are indicators. So if you 
get MACD, if you get stochastic, if you get RSI, this is created as uh derivative of price. So 
you get uh MACD that is always going after price, never anticipating. Yeah, price is real time. So 
you are watching what is happening as an effect in real time. But with volume, you are watching the 
narrative before the price created. I give you an example of something that I never explained. Okay? 
And this is something that really helped me to see the develop the developing pressure to be able 
to put at break even sooner than other people. 

00:27:22	Okay? So let's say that we are here. We have a 
long bias. We are out of balance and we have the previous day point of control. Okay. So with price 
action when can we put that break even? When we break this level. Yeah. You agree with me? Yes. 
Because we have level of protection that we can put here and we say okay it will retest and go. 
Yeah. We shouldn't break that low. Right. Volume we can use one tool that is called CVD. That is 
cumulative volume delta. What cumulative volume delta is giving you is a benchmark for pressure 
of volume. Mhm. So you are out of balance. So the 

00:28:00	probability you will find a new point of balance 
is high with cumulative volume delta. You see this is the price maybe you see the cumulative volume 
delta doing this when you are here the cumulative volume delta is doing this. What does it mean 
that aggressive buyers are really pushing on the gas and there is a lot of interest because as the 
price goes up you don't see sellers aggressive but you see that buyers are willing to buy at higher 
price and if we are at an auction and there is a a limited piece of Mustang from 1969 okay and 
the base auction is 1 million and you see buyers 

00:28:38	starting 1.2 1.4 1.6 six it means that the price 
is probably going up because they are interested in the piece. So what you can do when you see 
that cumulative volume delta is pushing up and you see this leg already building you can already 
put to break even. Yeah because you know that as the smallest retracement aggressive buyers will 
continue to push up and you are protected. Yeah. This is something that you can do with only 
with leading indicators you cannot do before. Of course, I didn't talk about global macro, but 
also global macro, it's a leading indicator or 

00:29:13	onchain analysis for crypto, but for intraday 
scalping, like orderflow is the benchmark tool. Let's take a break for a minute there, guys, cuz

to be fair because if you really think about an auction that's probably the closest that the 
everyday person might have some sort of insight into or at least know and understand how they 
operate uh as a as a usual auction. So in this 

00:31:29	case the car or house for example um you'll see 
the same thing if let's say even when there are buyers who want to buy but let's say if the 
auction price is starting too high they don't they don't really like where it's starting at 
you'll see actually the auction begins anyone at a million no one answers no one says anything so 
then the auctioneer or whoever's like running the auction will bring the price down until there's 
some interest and then you never know like it might seem like oh no one wants this car no one 
wants this uh vehicle or in this case obviously 

00:31:57	no one wants to participate or place any orders 
in this market. But then once it hits the level that people are interested at, let's say if it's 
that car example again, let's say we started at a million but no one's interested. Bring it down 
to 800,000. Now suddenly someone's interested, one person's interested. Okay, we bid it up, but 
now people who were there for that particular vehicle moment. Yes. And then you'll suddenly see 
how Yeah, we started at a million and no one was interested, but suddenly we're blasting up to 1.25 
25 million and there's still orders and still more 

00:32:26	bids and therefore that velocity and that amount 
of demand at the moment you go to the market price because if the market price is 2.1 million you 
start to see at 1.9 million of auction market participants saying okay let's go on increment 
of 50,000 not 200,000 so the market gets lower and you build new balance and then the point of 
control is the seller that close it usually the auction So um this is how really the market works 
and this is what I use daily to frame my entry and um then what's good about orderflow is that 
it's really um you can adapt it to every market 

00:33:10	condition. For example, if you have a model 
with price action that is working really good, you don't need to abandon your model. just see 
if you can get better precision and remove the losing trades using this concept. Mhm. So it's not 
something that you will not start from scratch. Yeah. Just expand the level of knowledge you 
have from candlestick charts. So like you said earlier as a trader and and a pure trader at 
that and who's someone who's focused on trading 100%. That's your goal is to how do you build more 
edge? How do you squeeze more edge out of the same 

00:33:46	knowledge? playbook or strategy that you're using 
because that's really what you do at that point. You're not jumping, okay, I've got this strategy, 
but I want to find a better one. That's not how the mindset is, right? And then if you come across 
a really good playbook and edge and strategy, you always can start to add that. But your focus 
point is how do I make this playbook the best it can be? How can I be the best trader possible? 
And in this case, you might have a profitable price action model, but your goal then is okay, 
how do I squeeze more out of it, right? So in 

00:34:14	terms of using orderflow if you're not using that 
already that would definitely help you to squeeze more out of it. Now not I'm sure there might be 
some people who try and learn orderflow and go n this is a bit more complex for me and uh therefore 
you know for that particular individual it might not be as helpful for example but I would say 
it's probably a slimmer amount of people right um but the worst thing you can do is just not 
even try because you're already writing it's like people who need to learn fundamentals right 
and macro they don't because they it's complex and 

00:34:44	you know the price action's enough much to study 
yeah but in reality when you look at even just this year but co was a great example of it for as 
a lot of traders came into the markets but even just this year for example was a great example 
last year yes we had quite a bull market but there wasn't really a crazy amount of fundamentals 
behind um you know in terms of like changes and volatility changes and market changes while this 
year we're we're just coming into towards the end of June and literally we've seen highs lows we've 
seen the markets completely shift month after 

00:35:15	month after week and it's probably not going to 
change and we call this a Trump But but um again if you don't know macro it's so easy for you to 
sit there and go the markets are crazy I can't understand what's going on versus the people who 
do have an understanding and it I won't even class it as like a deep deep deep understanding some 
people you just have a basic knowledge allows them to have more clarity and calmness which 
as a trader as we know is extremely important u one thing we'll do so from here where should we 
go from here should we should we uh recap the two 

00:35:44	models quickly did we we covered two right two 
to go one point before that is edge decay. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Before going to to recap the 
model, let's do it. Um the concept of edge decay is when your model lose edge. Mhm. Okay. And this 
is something I notice a lot with price action. So for example, before I was using supply and demand 
in trend following and when the volatility change for example you are creating one rule that you 
have moving average long and we are adding to the trend when you get here. Okay. uh volatility 
change. So the the length of the swing if it goes 

00:36:21	from here to here you already take a lot of stop 
loss not because you are wrong the direction is right but the market will just swing higher 
and I think every discretionary trader notice it. Yeah. So this is edge decay and it's your 
lose of edge in the change of market condition. What's also Jim Simmons was talking about with his 
renaissance fund and um with or the flow what it's interesting is that you cannot actually have an 
edge decay because what you are watching is the true nature of the market. So you are not framing 
the market in something that is close rule from A 

00:36:59	to B but you are understanding what's happening. 
And I will give you an example of something that improved my model by four or five point in we 
rate that it's a lot if you are a scalper and is the following one before if you are like closed 
in a range but you are trading price action and you are trading continuation with brick test model 
is really common. Okay. So you wait for this then you wait for the week down and on the on on the 
test you go long. Yeah. When if you start to do one simple exercise and you start to only use 
order flow to zoom out when this is happening 

00:37:39	like you you take one specific part. So you cannot 
say that order flow is complex. You take the same candle just you make an exercise watch cumulative 
volume delta here and orders. You can use also footprint for this. If you see that at this level 
there is a lot of a aggression and the cumulative volume delta is doing here this it means that this 
movement is not supported and the probability that you will go down it's here and is something that 
is telling you before the price bring you to stop. So you can just decide not to jump in. And this is 
a comp a concept that I want to cover because it's 

00:38:16	something that I went through when uh the price 
action model was not working properly during the um 2019 and I had to step up the game and I 
was thinking no no I need to study from zero and I need to implement something that will 
cancel and raise all the learning curve that I got with price action. But it's not like this 
just you will start from where you are before. Yeah, just understanding what's happening behind 
the market. Of course, it's easier to think that the market is dominated by some black entity 
behind the table because understanding the 

00:38:51	mechanic is difficult. But I can guarantee 
you that you will improve as a trader. Mhm. And uh so we go now on the summary of the two 
models. Yeah. And we start with the trend model. So this model is a trend following model 
and we will go before on the timing that is New York session. Okay. So we want the 
biggest amount of volatility to implement this model in live market condition and uh I don't 
advise to keep the trades for the night. So this is a model that gets close as soon as the 
market close. You don't bring overnight trades 

00:39:37	because you also need more margin for futures. 
It's not convenient at all. Just if you are in profit or if you are in loss, cut the position 
and tomorrow it's another day for this one. So this is the timing. Then when we go on the step 
one, the first step is understanding market state. We can only have two market state. We 
can have a balanced market price action going here and we can have an imbalance market. Okay, with this model we want to transact here. 
We are not interested in this market condition. 

00:40:22	So also for the gamblers uh you have one 
rule that keeps you out of the market and this is really important because when I 
start scalping with price action every movement was okay for me like every small 
impulse and then you say okay I took three stop for the day I'm out and then the big 
moves arrives. So this is the lock where you cannot enter if you don't have exactly 
what the market needs to tell you. Yeah, this is the market state and what we frame 
as the step one. Then we need the location. 

00:40:57	The location is exactly your swing point. That is this one. Okay. Mhm. 
that you need to analyze deeply because you need to understand if you want to jump in here, if you 
want to jump in here or just if you want to jump on the train sometimes from the lowest point 
because momentum is so high that you can just say okay I jump here but I cover myself here. So 
it's still a good riskto-reward rate. What you use to do this you you use profile. Yeah. Okay. Use 
profile and what you search is low volume node. 

00:41:34	Mhm. So where the mark let's make try to draw the 
profile. Okay. Say that this is the profile for the swing point. What we can see here is that this 
is the low volume node. Not the best drawing. But I think it's understandable that we're going to 
see on the charts, right? The the point where the lowest volume get transacted. What you can do here 
is do this. Okay. So what I do usually is I don't put a limit order. Okay? I put an alert a little 
bit below. Okay? Because when it arrives there, I want to see big trades, big orders. Okay? So as 
we were seeing before, we started from the timing, 

00:42:21	we went through the market state, we went 
through the location, go to the step three, that is execution or trigger. What you want 
to see is aggression. If you are seller, you want a big red ball. Okay? When you see 
a big red ball, you can jump in and your stop loss will go here and your target will be the 
previous balance area. Yeah. So, if we are here, the previous balance area, it's here. Let's see 
the P. This is our target. And we are going to take out not half the position and let it run. 
we are going to take out the full position 

00:43:01	because the probability is that the market will 
reverse from it 70% of the time. So we are it's just not worth to keep the position for only 30% 
probability more. Yeah, better that we take all that we can in this case. Now let's go to the 
model two and the model two is mean reverting. So the model 2 is using the market state 
that is the opposite. Yeah. So he's using consolidation. Market state is consolidation 
and is when the profile is protecting from breaking here and breaking here. Okay. So 
you get from here to here to here to here. 

00:43:49	What we are trying to take is the out of balance 
condition that get back inside balance. And as I told you, we are not trying to take the first 
swing because it's risky. Yeah, we are getting the second swing. So when we have the first breakout, 
we are just waiting for the retracement. It's the same concept as before. Now the location 
is this wing. Yeah. You frame the location, you wait for the retracement. Mhm. So let's 
consider that this is this wing. Same stuff low volume node aggression seller consider that we are 
here maybe where we go we don't go here this is an 

00:44:28	error that everyone is doing the probability is 
not high you go here you go to the where the bulk of the auctions taking place where the probability 
that you will go to balance it's really high and if you are wrong you want to be wrong immediately 
if you have big sell orders here immediately Here it's your stop loss. A small trick for the 
scalpers, aggressive scalpers. There is a way to avoid slippage or at least minimize slippage put 
the stop loss not above the high. Yeah. Because above the high there are a lot of orders and 
what you see is that market will accelerate. 

00:45:08	Example when you you take previous daily high, 
previous daily low, previous weekly high, previous daily low. You see that the market even 
if it's a failu now it's going down it accelerate. So you lose an additional amount of tick that 
you can protect. How you can protect them just put your stop loss one or two ticks below the 
high. Okay. So you are taken out before everyone that is before acceleration takes place. And it's 
worth it. I tested it and it's worth it because sometimes you get five ticks, six tick of and it's 
a lot because the overall chances of price getting 

00:45:41	to one or two ticks below that high and then not 
go for not it's almost zero. No, it's not zero. Sometimes it happens and you just want to cut your 
ends but on the long term like statistically wise it's worth it. Yeah, cuz in this case for example, 
just to recap, so this recap wise, timing wise, you're looking at potentially London, right? 
And then in your consolidation periods such as normally your summer months, right? Yes. um just 
as an example. But in terms of the recapping the thesis, it's the fact that yes, you know, we're 
in a range and yes, you could target here because 

00:46:16	price has shown that yes, we're going from high 
down to low, but the highest probability is that auction auction area where the bulk of the orders 
and transactions are taking place versus, okay, yes, we could get here, but there are chances that 
we could get to there and rebound back up to that auction area again or rebound back up to the high 
that there's there's too many variables trying to target here or especially lower versus the highest 
probable and that you know it's not guaranteed, nothing's guaranteed, but the chances are way 
more in your favor, especially considering the 

00:46:50	information you're taking on board. Uh because 
again, you're not just entering from the first spike out of the range. You're going to wait 
for your confirmation and then look to execute. Exactly. Exactly. And then consider that there 
are some days that they are really blessed days where you have this model. Yeah. Then the market 
breaks the low. you activate the second model for New York and you take two amazing target and you 
are done for the week. Um, so yes, these are the the two model. Now the tricky part is correctly 
identifying the consolidation because you can make 

00:47:23	it as simple as possible and say this is one day. 
Mhm. So I use the profile of the previous day. Yeah. Okay. So it's easy. You don't need to have 
headache about it. You just wait for the Okay. There is a more advanced model where you have 
more execution where you get the ability to identify the consolidation phase. Okay, you 
just take an orderflow platform and you see the compressed candles and you just plot the 
profile on there. This is what we were going to do because it needs a little bit more skill. 
M I will explain you pull out the profile and I 

00:47:58	will show you something really interesting that 
not trading view but some orderflow platform are willing to give you also the delta of the transact 
volume before so you can see for each level who is dominating the market this is really useful 
because if you see here that you are going up and is dominated by buyers it's not the best condition 
to get a buy trades because the probability that you will do this it's really high. Yeah. At the 
same time, if in this area you see a huge delta cell when you break out, it's your birthday. Yeah. 
You just go for it. Mhm. Should we go over the 

00:48:36	quickly the pros and cons and then we'll pull out 
the charts. Let's take a break for a minute there, guys, cuz I want to tell you about our incredible

on the pros and cons. The cons is that if you use 

00:50:15	the second model, compression days are killing 
you because sometimes uh especially if you don't work on the daily profile but you work on the um 
short-term profile that you can trace by yourself. Um consolidation is killing your win rate because 
maybe you take five small stop-loss. Yeah, five small stop losses maybe a lose a loss on $5,000. 
Mhm. Then you take one take profit and it's like 15 20,000 but at the same time psychologically the 
win rate gets lower and if you see a lot of red in your account even if at the end of the week you 
are still profitable it's heavy for beginners it's 

00:51:00	heavy. So one uh bad concept is consolidation that 
directly affect win rate for the model and this is the reason I created a second model because when 
I lose with one I make profit with the other one. So it's like balancing the equity curve giving 
you more execution but the draw down gets lower. So it's worth it. This is the first cons. The 
second one is it's stress. We need to be honest with it. Yeah. when uh um your trades gets to the 
level not in a proper but in a real account where the single position is worth the salary that you 
were taking for example 10 years ago. So you are 

00:51:41	risking 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 per position and 
in 2 minutes 3 minutes you can lose it. Mhm. Of course at the end of the month it's profitable but 
on the short term it's heavy on the mindset. Yeah. Specifically if you go through the moment and 
there will be moments where you take streak of stop- loss like in the world cup I show 
transparently transparently the trades I was taking and one day I received a lot of insult 
from the people on the Instagram because I've been transparent of one day taking eight stop loss 
like small stop loss like five tick 10 ticks but a 

00:52:17	lot of stop loss because it was a day that and you 
risk sometimes 0.2 0.2 2 0.3. So it's like nice stop loss is 1.8%. 2% is not a big amount. You can 
deal with it. But when you talk to people and you say look I took nine stop loss. You see learn 
to trade. Yeah. So so so they they just think that a profitable trader is a trader that having a 
huge amount of win rate. They don't consider that maybe the stop loss are incredibly smaller than 
gains. Yeah. So the the stress part and the the third cons is the time commitment. Mhm. Like to 
execute this model you cannot do it as an hobby. 

00:53:00	You cannot do it as a side hustle. You need to be 
in on the screen from the starting of the newer session to the end because the position not only 
need to be executed is set and don't forget it's set and check is something like this because you 
need to trail your stop you need to manage there's a model for real traders. This is very this is a 
model if you want that trading gets your fulltime income. Yeah. Okay. Now on the London session I 
manage three I manage companies with my business partner but in the new year session three or four 
hours I do this and it's necessary you cannot just 

00:53:38	get out you can't just decide that after a certain 
time you don't open trades so you can enjoy dinner that's of course can be can be something good 
on the pros the first one is number of trades Why this is good? Because draw down gets covered 
really fast if you have a big profit factor and sharper ratio. So you can take nine stop loss for 
the day but by the end of the week I was again in profit. I was high watermark. So I was creating 
new high on the equity equity curve and uh also a big number of trades creates something interesting 
for hedge funds that wants to give you capital. 

00:54:25	Mhm. Because a model that in 12 months does 2,400 
execution is more respected than a long-term model that in 12 months have 30 trades. Yeah. Because 
the data sample wise this model is more valuable. Interesting. It's giving you a lot of room of 
improvement and is giving you a lot of data analysis that you can input and you understand 
really fast if your model is not working properly in certain market condition because for example 
I have a benchmark that is the maximum amount of stop- loss I've taken that is 11 stop loss okay 
it's a humbling experience but you know that the 

00:55:07	market can stay in compression for one full week 
you know that every day it's a fake breakout for one week. I saw the last videos of Carmen Rosato. 
He was like taking a huge amount of uh stop-loss like for 3 weeks, but he's still in profit for the 
month. Yes. That's the good part about scalper, the number of execution, and it's really easy 
to go back in profit. The second good part about trading with this model is that you don't need 
headache. Why you don't need headache? because the prediction part is not there. You are just 
paid to read what the market is telling you. So 

00:55:47	I don't need to start to say considering the 
angle of gun maybe the price will skyrocket to this price because this no just this is the 
market state. This is the location. This is the aggression. This is this is my trades. Mhm. And 
another good part, maybe this is the best part. I should have put this that you cannot do revenge 
trading because if you don't have the condition to trade when you trade large amount of size, 
you just don't feel confident to execute. Mhm. If there are not the condition of aggression just 
it's not worth it to to do it. So the the third 

00:56:24	part is just there is no headache in deciding and 
no revenge trading in executing something that is not there. Yeah. You know with projection I don't 
know if you ever experience it but sometimes you see something that is not there just because you 
want to trade. So you create the setup well you can have a bias and then if let's say one time 
frame isn't giving you that bias you can just filter through until you find one. Like our time 
10 time frames let's say eight of them are long but you want to be short. You'll just go to the 
one that says sure. Yeah. You know. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:56:55	This is something that uh I also did it like our 
ego is bringing us to the condition that if we say in our mind that the bias for the day long 
as and the news are long we will just take every demand here because we think every demand that is 
getting break it's a fake and even down here even say it's taking liquidity till this wing doesn't 
get st out and of course this is a liquidation. So you also trade the reverse and then when you 
get destroyed you that's normally the last last resort right last resort. Yes. But another pro 
is that it's a high risk it can be a high risk 

00:57:28	to reward. It can huge risk to reward when uh it's 
not common. I need to be honest but when NASDAQ is pushing is pushing heavy and when you are in from 
the breakout of the level and you are because you need to consider that our target is the P. Okay. 
If you are here there is no P because you are creating value up. True. So you just decide to 
trail for the day. Trail. Yeah. Okay. Sometimes you get some 1 to 30 1 to 40. It's not common but 
it can happen. But even high risk reward like 1 to 4 1 to 5 that's a common reassurance. One to one 
to 2.5 is the minimum. Yeah. 1 to five is common. 

00:58:06	Yeah. 1 to 10 20 is not common. It only when I 
do 1 to 10 1 to 20 it means that you see on the NASDAQ 2% 3% for the day. Yeah. So it means that 
I really follow the market properly but I cannot do 1 to 10 if the market is doing 0.25 for the 
day 0.5 like I'm in tune with it like I I plus it's not like you're focused on risk-to-reward. 
It's just part of the model. You're focused on understanding what's going on and then reacting 
and following your model accordingly. Yeah. When when your model and when your primary focus gets 
to protection of capital and risk management, 

00:58:45	you increase the profit. Definitely like when you 
put your focus on something that you think it's not directly related is when you make the most 
amount of profit. Well, now let's go into well the charts I guess the actual trade examples. Yeah. 
So, as we've established, this is truly a strategy and playbook for real traders. traders who really 
want to not only trade but understand the markets at a deep level. So now we're actually going to go 
over trade examples on the charts uh of those same playbooks and uh what do we have in front of us 
here? So this is a orderflow platform is a deep 

00:59:20	chart and uh what we have here is volume profile 
uh distribution profile of specific consolidation area. So what I was explaining to you before is 
that you can make it stupid simple putting just daily profile. You can do this also from trading 
view. Maybe the volume will not be as precise as this or you can just do it um identifying the most 
interesting compression area. As you can see here they are clearly visible where the market didn't 
transacted higher or lower. It just stayed in compression. I use every day this area. And what I 
wanted to show you before is exactly this. You see 

00:59:59	here is the volume. Okay, this is the volume. This 
is how much volume is transacted per price level. This blue line is the value area. So every time 
you see the model in consolidation when it gets back, get back in target. Get back in target up 
get back in target down get back in target. This one will be stop loss. But you have the second 
model. You have the execution model of this in this consolidation. We need also to be honest that 
you don't identify it immediately. You need you can identify maybe from here you can take these 
two trades. This one is really uncommon because 

01:00:36	you start to see the real compression. Yeah. 
It's too early. Exactly. Now what is interesting is that you can frame also the delta. What is 
the delta? The measure amount of volume getting transacted from one side on one place level. the 
aggression and if you see here look how much is big the delta is exactly at the level where they 
accumulate the last time and created this extreme breakout. Okay, this one here I will also explain 
you later why the news catalyst is something where a lot of people think that the market is seeking 
liquidity but at the moment this movement is make 

01:01:17	because market maker go out of the market. So the 
volatility gets higher because you have less limit orders and in this case uh the market explode 
up to create a new level of balance. So in this case we have reversion model, reversion model, 
reversion model, reversion model and stop here probably aggressive model here breakout and we 
will go deep dive in the lower time frame because now we are in 5 minutes then we will drop down 
to 1 minute. This model can be used in every time frame like to give to the audience a little bit of 
reference. You can either do 15 minutes 3 minutes, 

01:01:59	you can do 1 hour 5 minutes or you can do the 
most aggressive one. That is what I do. 5 minutes 1 minute. Okay. So 5 minutes is to watch the 
breakout candle. Okay. This one I don't go deep dive inside it because it's impossible to execute. 
You see it went out of balance. No retracement, low volatility, low liquidity. So it's impossible 
to take. Then we will go to this one that is the 23 is this morning. Okay. Okay. This morning we 
will see exactly how the model play out perfectly on the trend following side. So I will show you 
how also the model behaves in London session. Even 

01:02:38	if I only use this in New York session, the model 
really works as also reversion model in London and New York. Yeah, I want to show you the entity 
of the momentum to explain you why I do New York. This is New York. This is you see how much is 
compressed more retracement. This when you take it, it just explode. Yeah. And this is what I was 
trying to explain you before as the flow getting in tune with the flow. So what we do now that our 
area are clear, we can go to one minute time frame and we will start with the first one. Okay. What 
we have here is the previous area. This is the 

01:03:20	value area high. This is the value area low. 
This is the poke. Okay. So, we are clearly out of balance from this movement. You can either 
be aggressive or just say I want to clear out also the high. Yeah. So, I just want that there 
is no obstacles in my explosion higher. This is something that I usually do. I don't transact 
only when you break out. I wait because it can be the reversion model here, you know. Then 
what we do, this is the magic. We activate the orders that are getting filter for the amount of 
aggression. Yeah. Okay. So my filter usually is 

01:04:06	around 20 to 30. Okay. In this case, I think it's 
pretty visible. And this is the best example you can have. Look how much is balanced. Look what 
happens when momentum is building. So what I was saying to you even before the breakout, if you 
know how this stuff works, can you understand that something is happening here? You are going 
from small orders balance to someone buying aggressively and continuation aggressively. Also 
look at the amount of big orders that you have in bullish momentum and in bearish momentum. So you 
can clearly understand if you are following the 

01:04:44	flow or not. So the trades here is like I was 
saying before either the momentum continuation trades that you get framing the level with a huge 
presence of buy aggression and this is another model that I also show on YouTube that is just not 
because this stuff happens in one minute. Okay. So every candle is one minute. You can either be 
fast and use only big orders or just as I was saying before plot the profile from the beginning 
to the end of the impulse and say look let's zoom out in here what we have we have a lack of volume 
here. Yeah. So there is a huge area that we can 

01:05:29	use as a low volume node. Okay. So when you have 
the retracement and you get close to the area, you can decide to take this as an aggression 
or I will take this one as an aggression. Okay, maybe you enter here, you have the mitigation of 
the level and then you have just continuation. Now the more you wait to enter, the more it gets 
risky. Yeah. Because if you enter here, you are getting to a point where sellers can say it's 
too expensive the price. I went out of balance. But you want to be in fast and close fast. Yes. 
Okay. So from here you can just identify from 

01:06:10	when the aggression is still bullish. I will 
start to be a little bit afraid here. I will start to say look the market is compressing 
again. The sellers are starting to fight back this huge momentum. Yeah. So maybe I can put my 
stop loss in profit. Gotcha. Below this low. Then what happens that the market against you don't 
need to be a wizard. The market give you clues because this breakout you see it's participated 
by huge buyers. The sellers try to get control back here. But what the market print a week. So 
it means that they cannot control the movement. 

01:06:51	And I would completely take out the position where 
I see that because big sellers no follow up small sellers big sellers huge follow up and close on 
this candle you can go out you can go out on stop loss in profit or you can go out when you reach 
your risk-to-reward rates. Okay. Because with this as an example just to highlight. Yes. So as you 
say sellers no follow through but consolidation. Yes, we continue. We break out. We see 
the buyers again from the low. Yeah. Wick, but no follow through. Exactly. But could you say 
that these sellers are entering, they're maybe not 

01:07:31	getting stopped out, they're still in the market. 
So then when you finally see the sellers and then the follow through now, you know, you you use 
this buildup of sellers previously in included as well. What what I use ex is exactly what you 
see. What I use is volume spread analysis. That is the relationship between price and volume. 
So if I see like you were saying here sellers, okay, trying to push the market down but they are 
punching a wall. They are not going through. So what they are doing they can either stay still 
inside the position if this movement stop them 

01:08:06	out. Yeah. The market will accelerate of course. 
Okay. So what I see is that this aggression is the first one in all this movement that print this 
huge candle. Yeah. Why staying in a movement that is saying we are getting the control is like 
getting inside a world and being by the side of the weak parties like doesn't make sense. 
And from here you can see that participation is mainly by the sellers. Yeah. I want to show 
you something. I want to clear a little bit and get back remember how the volume is inside this 
area. Yeah. Okay. Let's remove for one second the 

01:08:44	big trades and let's go here. You agree that this 
is a compression area? Yes. Okay. Let's print it. You see that the market is not accepting below 
the value area because what happens is that here is transaction incorrectly but every time they go 
deep discount buyers enter aggressively and get back the the position here. This is exactly what's 
happening. Let's go on the today price action. And so we we saw one New York and we watch 
one London session and this is not a normal London session. This is a London session. 
This is after the bombing of Iran. So the 

01:09:30	volatility it's even higher than a usual 
London session because the market needs to rebalance this gap. Same situation rates. So if 
I tell you forget about everything, it's here. Just tell me in which area there is the major 
amount of delta aggression from the buyers in which area you can see. Would it be the buyers you 
say? Yes. Exactly this one. And if you see Yeah. I'm getting tapping in. If you see this is exactly 
how you can identify when it's an accumulation and when it's a distribution. Yeah. This is where all 
the traders are struggling like why accumulation 

01:10:10	distribution. But how can I identify objectively 
what's happening? If you see from this level, aggression of buyers catalyst. Yeah, let's go 
down to the one minute. We already in one minute. Perfect. We activate the big trades again. Same 
model. What we see? Buyers aggressive catalyst. Catalyst catalyst catalyst. Again, you see what 
sellers are doing? They are trying to push the market up down. But what's happening? They're 
getting [ __ ] anniated by buyers. So if you get the profile as before from the starting of the 
swing to the end of the swing, what you can see? 

01:10:51	You can see that volume is equally distributed 
here and you start to have a low volume from here. So in this case to follow the exact mo model, 
you will be unfilled in this position. Okay, let's go educationwise on and see what's happening 
and reading here what you can do considering that you are still in the same area. You see that 
from here to here they create a new dealing range new area. So you can do just the same from 
here to here and you can go deep dive inside this location. Yeah. Look where is the value area 
low and look where is the low volume node. You 

01:11:35	see this lack of volume here? Yes. So you have the 
low volume node conceding with the value area low conceding with this is free money. This is [ __ ] 
free money. You wait for this candle. You put the stop loss here. You target either because even 
if you want to target let's say here, okay, you are risking per contract $160. In the worst case 
scenario, if you want to be out really fast, you are risking 160 to make 500. Yeah. Okay. So the 
risk-to-reward is more than one to three in this case. But this is the excursion the market gives 
you. So you you see how the risk to reward can 

01:12:13	get really huge if you get in tune in the market. 
Yes. And the addition to the position can be done every time that the markets create a new eye. This 
a failed auction. It doesn't break out. But then it break out here. Okay. To the to there. Yeah. 
Again look zero volume here. like from the profile punching the wall I will not get this trade 
because I don't have aggression so it's not as safe as this one but again the bias is completely 
fine and this is the both of the model we saw the reversion model and the trend following model and 
the first time that I find out this myself was a 

01:12:57	h aha moment yes because I just went to order 
fluency so I can see before it happens how the volume is developing and also small exercise when 
the market gets taken back in control by sellers. Mhm. All these small volume then huge aggression 
from sellers but look also where the market reacts when it comes back. What is doing now? This 
is actual price action. We are not charting the past. Yeah. sellers in control where they 
will find the first problem when they get back to these aggressive buyers. Otherwise, they will 
continue to push the market down in this case. And 

01:13:39	when you see this case, it can be a punch on 
the wall because sellers try to push it down, but buyers protect the level. And if you see it 
closely, what is developing is a trend following condition because we are going after all this 
balance, we are going out of balance. This is the first breakout. Yeah. And they can go back 
to the previous point of control. So they have a long room to go here. And you will notice I 
don't know if it will happen live that if this level get tapped back it accelerate because 
sellers are adding to their position. For now 

01:14:17	it is out of balance print and it's going to 
rebalance to the pock because it didn't it was not a successful breakout. Yes, that's the reason 
I say always trend following or reversal. Wait for the second drive. Don't take the first drive 
because you can get tap in in a fake out. Yeah, that's it. It's not difficult. But I know it's a 
lot of information for the audience for the first time, but I think it's a lot cleaner than some of 
the order flow breakdowns I've seen before. They just make it hard to not let people understand. I 
mean different platforms as well um you can make 

01:14:52	it like so in this case with the what we would 
call the the bubbles for example but in terms of execution large orders. Yes. So if you filter 
filtered it so that it only shows specific size of orders. Exactly. specific size because you can 
take it on and off as well. You want to filter out the noise. No, you want to see what actual 
big orders are doing is the same concept as uh commitment of traders for long term. You are 
just watching the the participants that matter. If you move one contract in mini, I'm 
not interested in it. Just you can do 

01:15:23	what the [ __ ] you want. But if someone is 
adding 100 contract on NASDAQ on one minute, it's interesting. Mhm. Like the momentum 
in terms of price getting to this point, this high that we were talking about here cuz as 
we were talking about potential trades from down here. Yes. Uh what is there anything to the left 
as to why price is reacting at this area? I think there's a high to the left that we were originally 
looking at. You want to see where we are going. Is there anything of significance in this 
area where it would lead you? We we don't 

01:15:54	need to to guess. Okay. So, let's remove 
this part so we don't know exactly where it was. Let's print it and let's go down here. 
Okay. Mhm. Now, let's clean all the noise and let's go down here. Okay. As you can see 
in all this area the value area is this one. So I will make white the value area. So this is 
when the market considering all the profile the comprehensive profile also of the gap is when 
it's getting expensive for market participants. Okay. But if we get deeper we notice that 
the biggest peak of sellers you see this 

01:16:42	one. Okay. So this level can be something 
interesting from sellers perspective wise the market reacted from this value area is 
distributing and as I was saying to you probably is going back to the PC that is this level and 
it's exactly overlapping with the big volume trades. Yes. So the probability of a follow-up 
short now it's higher in this case even if they get before back to the pock and then redist red 
distribute back down but I want to show you also here from this profile was it understandable that 
this was the reaction level from the delta that 

01:17:30	is developing yes because this pro this supply 
is the real way way of plotting supply you are just watching volumewise when there is the most 
amount of executed trades not limit but executed trades this mean that the auction get too much 
expensive they want to sell off and in this case and they sell off till here then what happened 
here exactly is that the price get too low Mhm. to sell because it's getting cheap again to buy 
also for buyers you know. So from this perspective we have this buyers trying to aggressive no follow 
up sellers no follow up. So we are getting inside 

01:18:14	the decision range. Mhm. The first one that 
will get breakout, you will see a catalyst in that direction and probably the first level is 
this one. Cuz even in this case, for example, if this was to break the high, even though we 
might not be looking to trade this, but if we were looking to make a prediction, would we then break 
the high and then look to go to uh the high of the value area potentially or even the the previous 
I will say the P P first. uh like distribute against the PC and then if you need to refine 
an area where you can probably see a reaction 

01:18:47	I will say this supply here like you were saying 
not because it's the best level to react because the best level to react is the value area high but 
because uh uh this delta here it's really reliable on how much aggression is it giving. Hey guys. So, 
we've had obviously the biggest nightmare you can imagine on Chart Fanatics. As you saw there, we 
were middle of screen recording, storage issue, uh screen recording cut. We cut, no problem. 
We came back, uh we pressed screen record, but something happened. However, what we're going 
to do to make up for it, one, we're going to break 

01:19:21	down exactly what happened step by step after the 
fact, no problem. But we're going to actually wait until New York uh open and then we're going 
to do some live uh price reading then. um you know at an actual time where Fabio does trade and 
we'll be looking at specific things as well. So, we're excited for that. Hey guys, we're back. I 
promised you New York session. We are 30 minutes before just under 30 minutes before the session 
open. Um we can recap exactly what happened uh since we left as well and uh super excited 
for this first time ever. I don't think I've 

01:19:54	ever seen a video where it's done this where it's 
educational showing the concepts but then actually trading it live thereafter and you know calling 
out price essentially. I'm very excited. No one better then of course with Fabia. Yes. Do you want

01:22:11	we are here. We are stuck in a range. We are on 
fair value. Before we treat to do a recap, we saw this punch to the wall, the aggression of the 
seller, the follow up to the balance area. And now there is the first piece of information that we 
can get that was not present before is this punch of aggressive sellers without follow follow up 
getting to the discount level getting back inside the range. So I think as I was saying before that 
this high for the day it's something that will get destroyed probably at the beginning of the market 
open because the structure that I see now even if 

01:22:45	I have the information that sellers are getting 
aggressive and building up here the structure of the market that we never need to forget is still 
bullish and as you can see this is the level where the majority of aggression is getting this is the 
level where sellers are getting really aggressive. There is a dry up of volume and as you can see a 
low volume node. This is exactly what the market printed here. So in 20 minutes we have the first 
setup probably that can either be breakout here breakout and test if the volume is supporting it. 
Otherwise we can get a buy from the discount but 

01:23:23	this will be more risky from here. You can see 
that they are starting to fight because it's pre-market opening. This is the reason why 
I never trade pre-market opening because you see the battle but you don't know who will win it 
because we are stuck in a range. So from the data that we have seen here the size of the bubble 
is controlled by sellers. So it means and also the price is going down. So they are winning the 
battle but we need to remember that we have these big boys here ready to protect the price. M so 
at the moment I don't feel confident to to check 

01:23:57	any any setup. I prefer that we check closely. 
We should expect the first drive not at market opening but 5 minutes before and people that trade 
will see it often like they are preparing the dealing range testing on the market opening and 
then getting in the direction. So what I expect is that if we are going to get really long, yeah, 
this eye needs to be taken before 20 minutes. So I mark this eye if we're going to get long. If we're 
going to get long. Now I will create some scenario that are all rule based. Okay. So let's remove 
this one and let's make some scenario. So the 

01:24:41	first scenario is that these sellers are going to 
get absorbed. Okay. Now if these sellers are short here, probably they are going to get liquidated 
here. If the price during market opening spike ups really hard, they are forced to close their 
position. Closing a cell will create more momentum long. Okay. Watching how much they are pushing 
short makes me think that they are either closing long position from here. either they are getting 
some scalp pre-market opening and price will get back to this level uh 21822 before skyrocketing 
long. If we need to be conservative or it's the 

01:25:22	only setup is break out here test the level only 
when you have a closure of the candle we go back to 1 minute. Yeah. So we get the real execution 
and uh the market now will prepare the setup for the market session open. So aggressive sellers 
this can be seen also at what traders call fake out. So the fake move before the opening and then 
collapsing, not collapsing but rising up. And as you can see, let's make a comparison. The sides of 
the ball, the red ball, it's bigger, right? Yeah. But the result is really bigger. Like with small 
volumes, buyers are getting better results. If you 

01:26:00	see here, so it's really important to see to plot. 
This is something that I do often to put a profile from the first ball to the last ball. Okay? Like 
this. and check who is going out. I show you. We can always hide the trades. So you have only raw 
price action and volume distribution and you can see the sellers are not yet managing to close 
their candle below the value area low. So we are still even in a small time frame and a small data 
range we are still consolidating and compressing. Yeah, the direction of the market is not clear 
at the moment and uh usually it gets really 

01:26:44	clear the direction for the day from 15 minutes 
to 30 minutes inside the opening of the session. Cut. So it's normal. It's totally normal what's 
happening. Now they are loading position. Now this one it's already a big information for me. If 
this candle stays like this and we take this high, you can also try the the aggressive setup. But we 
will only use the model that I explained before. We will not because people can get confused 
with too much information. So let's let's go easy. But as you can see, they put aggressive 
sellers here, but the followup it's almost zero. 

01:27:22	Why? Because again, the buyers are protecting 
this position. Yeah. And in the overall bias if you see what's happening at the moment is 
that from the previous range of compression the market tried to break out. Yeah. But it 
failed. So structure-wise we are still long. Now let's remove all the unnecessary data 
and let's put the big trades. And one thing you mentioned was that those big trades pre 
previously when we were looking at the charts, there wasn't that many because we weren't in 
session yet. The session had getting huge. And you 

01:28:01	said like when we're in New York session, you're 
going to see it like a so much and we're not even in the session just yet, but you can already see 
an increase. You know what I like about this about these tools and these platforms that volume is pro 
um bulls are proportional to volume. So when there is too much volume and not clear direction, 
your market get floated by bulls. So it's not visible the price and you are forced to stay out 
because you cannot see what's happening behind. So it's like an insurance on your hand to stay 
calm like do not do anything and uh what I would 

01:28:35	really love and the my favorite setup possible 
is when market explode following up by green level and you can just jump in at the first level 
when it pulls back in a low volume node. This is amazing. Now this is totally normal and this 
is the reason I strongly advise not to trade like 10 minutes before the session, 20 minutes 
before the session because you will be liquidated and then maybe your direction was right. Yeah. 
But it will be [ __ ] up by volatility. This is something that not all traders take into account 
the volatility range can change by session. 

01:29:16	So a model that works for runon session it's not 
guaranteed that will continue to create alpha and generate revenue in the new year session. An 
example of this is the mean reversion model. You will see now if we apply m reversion model 
here we will be get destroyed by market and you will get also slippage because it's normal. It's 
compressing here. Still the entity of the sellers is huge but there is no followup. What does it 
mean that someone is absorbing this order and if they are absorbing this order if you watch only 
color you say it's controlled by sellers but I 

01:29:53	still have my narrative long still think that we 
are going to get the high for the day momentum is building up we are getting 10 around 10 minutes 
13 minutes before the session and as I told you we are going you expect that high to take to target 
the design now what can we expect when we target like explosion like acceleration like we were 
seeing before. Why? Because these huge orders are getting close. They don't want to be before 
session. Yeah. With this heavy and being in the wrong direction. Yeah. So they tried to anticipate 
the fall down of price but as you can see it's not 

01:30:32	going really good for them. So we are going to 
see when the market approach exactly this high. as of now still not getting broken. What 
we want to see is this green balls here like we did in all the previous situation. 
Yeah, this is a good setup for follow-up. Aggressive setup if we want to cover 
everything. One aggressive setup can be the anticipation on the first ball with 
a stop loss below the sellers to get to the high. But it's a setup that you are still 
trading the noise. Yeah. So something that 

01:31:14	you cannot expect will have the same way 
rate of a good frame trend following setup. So you see when you get back inside the range 
the balls are so big that you cannot even see what's happening and this is keeping you away from 
interacting with the market like transactioning in terms of like what parameters 
if any or settings have you put to identify these large orders? Is there specific for 
Yes. Yes. For the five minutes and one minutes for New York session you can use 30 contract as 
a filter. 30 contract and um um during London 

01:31:55	session you can go with 20. It's it's pretty 
accurate like this and so the larger it is that mean it's more than 30 the more maybe these are 
100 contract got like so big and I created like this proportional so you don't need to click 
on it see how much contract but you immediately see that there is a big sell aggression there got 
like it's see sell I was expecting that the I buy would but sellers so they are still keeping here 
why before session they are still keeping here because the direction is not clear who want to 
transaction here when you can get whip side high, 

01:32:29	whip side low, you're out of the market. Yeah, you 
are getting liquidated with every direction. So, and these buyers or sellers, they can be anyone, 
right? They could be, you know, a retail trader with large capital or it could be your funds 
or whatever it may be. Exactly. Exactly. Now, an information that we cannot unsee is that at 
the eye, they are still loading short even if the market is going to push the eye. So the the 
narrative it's a little bit shifting because if this low gets taken we have this breakout 
is interesting also the short till here why 

01:33:08	I will not take this position because the whole 
picture is long so why should I take one to one risk-to-reward when I can wait and get a 1 to 3 1 
to four 1 to5 this is the the model we need to to use and the model is keeping you you out out 
of lot of trades like we need to be evidence based and oriented on a large number of sample. 
Executing 25,500 sample in a world cup can give you the taste of what's worth to do and what's 
not worth to do because maybe one times out of 10 now we go short. Yeah. But all the other times 
the seller getting destroyed and the test is here 

01:33:48	and you just lose. Yeah. To get so small movement. 
That's because I think that's one thing that's universal across any trading strategy is that you 
focus on quality. Yes. Rather than just anything that could work or you know this has a chance of 
working and it could work one out of 10 times or whatever it may be because I feel like that one 
time you do take and it does work. It always just reinforces you the next time to take it again. 
Right. Take it again. Take it again. And you know it might work two three times if you're lucky and 
then the next 20 30 times it's not going to work 

01:34:18	but you're still thinking on those two or three 
times it does. Exactly. Versus when you have an actual plan, you know, quality trade playbooks 
and you follow those playbooks, that's where your consistency will come from, your longevity 
will come from as a trader. That's where you're really going to start to scale your journey. And 
scale your journey doesn't mean that it's going to happen fast. But what it means is you will 
have progress. And the funny thing is it will happen faster than the alternative of yes road 
is the fastest road. So it's always like this. 

01:34:49	Now what I'm doing in precession is marking up the 
biggest delta volume. Yeah. So I want to know so delta volumes on the left right? Yes. I want to 
see at the market opening which level I can see that are getting tapped. I want to use different 
colors where use just deep red for this one. And for the buy part, I take the swing on the 
low and I see what's the level with most amount of volume. That clearly is this cluster of by 
volume. Yeah, to be honest, there is also this one is smaller but is still here. These are the level 
that we can see in 7 minutes. get and from here we 

01:35:39	already know what to expect when to expect it. So 
do you sit on the 5minut time frame when marking out your analysis when it comes to execution 
wise one minute? Yeah. Yes. Clearly like this. Now chart is only showing us the levels color. We 
can see the aggression and we can see the actual execution. So now we don't need 5 minutes 
anymore. We can just go down to 1 minute. Can zoom in. You see how much they are big 
when you go here. You can see clearly that this aggression at the moment is getting completely 
absorbed. Yeah, this got absorbed. Do you ever 

01:36:23	think like for example in this case this person 
tried to sell, got absorbed. Could that be the same person like stacking into a trade or is that 
not sort of how? You cannot know if it's the same operator but for sure you know that these traders 
are in draw down and there is still interest in the sellers. So what I can see is that they are 
trying to build a sell position and they will be forced to close if market volatility spikes. So 
if I get these aggressive buyers and all these sellers needs to close the position we arrive here 
the market opening and we are closed because it's 

01:36:57	324. This is the first moment I would expect. 
And so in this case, if price did break above this level, you're not interested in trading 
that to the next level. You're interested once price gets to that level. Exactly. Okay. Exactly. 
Because I I need to see. But would you say it's still important, sorry, to have this context even 
if you're not looking to trade to that next level, it's still important to understand what's going 
on because you are training for the procession procession and creating a narrative. So when you 
know how to do it um you are still understanding 

01:37:29	with your subconscious mind what's happening 
because you need to be really fast. Yeah. And you need to reason fast and if you don't do it and you 
do only for your setup on 15 second and 1 minute is not enough fast to then execute at the right 
moment. You see how much volume and interaction is starting 5 minutes before like I told you 
not at 30 5 minutes before they are preparing the order from what we can see here this is a huge 
information aggressive sellers still to this level buyers with better results all these are getting 
absor absorbed this is not my narrative getting 

01:38:06	wasted or this is my narrative getting confirmed 
so even more I should expect now that either from here or either from Here we reaccumulate in the 
last 5 minutes and we shoot up. All these sellers are in pain. They need to close and the market 
create an expansion move up. Okay, it breaks. I can take the long from there and I'm done for the 
session. Like one one setup with high win rate. But understanding the narrative before makes you 
also understand market participants how they are thinking and if they are proven wrong. Yeah. 
With this amount of contract you cannot hold 

01:38:47	anymore. Even if you have a millionaire account 
you need to close sooner or later. Yeah. Are these market executions or they market execution not 
limits? Like I never watch limits. Like you can get to feel a taste of the market but because the 
limits apparently they can they can cancel. Yeah, they cancel. So they what do they call 
it? Spoofing is it? Is that what? Yeah, they call spoofing like putting order to create 
market pressure then removing. It's manipulating the perception of other market participants. 
But with execution just these are executed 

01:39:17	market. There is someone that is with huge 
sell you know there if you if it close you see it. Yeah you see. So uh in this case so in 
the first minute of market opening you will not see the chart it would get balls it's it will 
get like something like this does does this uh large aggressive buyer that failed up here does 
that make you yeah you are getting good you are getting this is an aggressive buyers that created 
a failed auction so the buyers here got like they tried really hard like this but the sellers won 
here in this battle also the sellers won. Okay. 

01:39:57	Because they are transactioning down. Yeah. 
So in this that's the reason you wait for your confirmation and you don't jump here because 
even if the bias is long you don't know if they will reach here or the second level that 
attract. I only know that I only know that I want to be in if this level gets broken. Yeah. 
So, let's see what they do. 3 minutes before a setup for a scalp position. A little bit more 
risky is if these sellers don't have a follow-up and got absorbed by buyers shooting up here. 
But this is a risk position. But this can be I 

01:40:38	show you only to to give to the audience a taste. 
this one like risking $300 and getting $1,100 is not a stupid position. It's just a position 
that you are taking inside the noise. Yeah, I can take this kind of position only if I'm 
sitting in profit for the day. Okay. Like it's it's not uncommon that I take them but I need to 
use profit and not use market um like um account equity. Yeah. Because using house money, right? 
Yeah. like before I need to take money from the market then I can take this kind of trades the win 
rate it's lower on this but if you consider the 

01:41:18	risk-to-reward it's uh like one to four so it's 
it's pretty good I just put this risk to reward because I want to let you understand that if these 
sellers fail they will catalyze up now I need the first minute if this one gets broken the setup 
is not valid but if in market open at um 3:30 you recover this level like and this one gets not 
broken. This is the target. So let's see how the market will behave from what we are seeing at the 
moment. Sellers one. Yep. Sellers one. Buyers one. Yeah. Here. So you are getting a bias and a level 
that start to get interesting. Let's zoom in. It's 

01:42:02	not visible. So considering the platform, you 
should not interact in this position even before because you can't see. You cannot see what's 
happening here cuz the first execution can be taken after market open and we are still before. 
So one trigger can be the break of this eye for example for a long. So now that we are getting 
inside if this eye get broken a really aggressive position can be entering at the break of this with 
the stop loss here targeting the high and I think it's even more than uh as a riskto-reward even 
more than one to to four. It's 1 to5 probably. 

01:42:38	So market is opening. They didn't break the high. 
So no position gets executed at the moment. Now we are in the second buy area. Yeah. So we need to 
check how the volume is behaving at the moment. Now these traders are in profit. Yes. All these 
buyers that position themsel before the opening needs to close position. This will bring price 
lower. All this movement is made by them. Now, now that we are in market opening, we can start to 
take position or do analysis that we can actually use. So, let's see the the first information 
that we have is that sellers still want this 

01:43:21	battle at the moment and they are getting stopped 
only here. Okay. So, still in the noise remember our rules till we don't get here the premium 
setup is not executed. Yeah. So inside here what can be something interesting for us? The first 
information that we can have is sellers really aggressive here that don't have a follow-up short. 
Yeah. So if this candle start to get populated by a lot of sellers but get back here. Yeah. This can 
be a long but again it's a long that you can you take inside market ranging. So let's just wait 
here because you had a you have a level beneath 

01:44:06	this right and towards the low. Uh I think the 
main level of the buyers are getting destroyed. Yeah. So the only reason I can engage in a risky 
position here is if this one prove me that it's a fake out. How can they prove me that it's a fake 
out? They need to recover all this. Yeah. This one needs to be a full week and they need to break 
up again from this high. If they don't do this, you see sellers are completely dominating this 
market at the moment. So not engaging here. You know in price action you can 
try this long because you don't see 

01:44:48	this. So you see you think it's it's 
retracing. I can buy this count. No, you you you probably think like 
break and retest the level. You know, this is this is something that if you are price 
action trader, you cannot know because you are not good but because you don't see that they 
are willing to sell stronger at lower point. Yeah. So the auction is getting short. Which one 
is the first level we can protect? We need to go with the profile on everything they build also 
during London session, not only during the range, 

01:45:31	this big area and this low volume node like 
also Carmen is doing. This is a low volume node and this is the delta. Yeah, this is the 
last protection level. If this one is breaking, they are recovering this cell and they are 
collapsing and he's in in that scenario what would you do? Would you just then in the scenario that 
they get sell my narrative will change because they break a balance level not on the up on the 
downside. Okay. So my day is short. Yeah. If my day is short I will still use the same model just 
I will not get long I will get short. Gotcha. Like 

01:46:06	my long day gets activated if we break this. Yeah. 
My short day at the same time gets activated if we break the compression range that is all this 
range. If they arrive here we can try something but here there is something that is undeniable. 
They are on this level. They are pushing out but I don't see a lot of follow-up shot. Yeah. So here 
the buyers you see how many volumes so much. Yeah. Here the buyers are protecting it limit orders. So 
either they slice through it, but if they start to recover and they get back inside the range, this 
is a a setup that also Patrick Neil is using with 

01:46:46	volume. And you see the good part about volume is 
keeping you up. Is keeping you out of the market when it's not ready here because let's go again 
to the narrative here. If it breaks the low, yeah, we get long. It continue down. Okay, here. If it 
breaks the high, we can go here. Why? Because if the volume don't does this, this means that 
the sellers are controlling all this market movement. Yeah. You don't need to predict. Just 
need to see what's happening here is the first time for the market opening where buyers are 
protecting a level. Yeah. In an interesting 

01:47:24	in an interesting situation. So this one can be 
the first long position if it gets confirmed by a little bit of buy aggression. At the moment 
it's only sell. Yeah. The moment is only sell. So now the only thing to do is wait what what 
they can do. Now one position that gets really interesting is the squeeze of the trapid sellers. 
Mhm. When is the squeeze of the trap sellers? When you recover all the aggressive sellers. Yeah. They 
are getting fake out. So they are willing to close the position and the market is accelerating high. 
You know let's see what is happening here. This is 

01:48:04	the first footprint of long yeah position from 
the level that we saw. Still someone can think why you don't take a long position here because at 
the moment if you see who created the swing like we were talking before is completely dominated by 
sellers. Yeah, this is a really risky position. If we start to get back here we can take position 
on the breakout with stop loss below the level. But remember the model is one. You need to break 
and test this level. Otherwise, you just stay out. When this level gets broken, the game start. 
You can add the position, you can follow up, 

01:48:45	you can do a lot of things. Now, I want to show 
you how much it's useful to see this volume in higher time frame like five minutes. From here, 
it's clear. It's clear because you see we agree that this is the low volume node. Okay. The 
profile distribution achieved the value area low. Mhm. Okay. So, we are on the value area low. 
The sellers didn't got a follow through. They took the low. Yeah. Okay. And created a failed auction. 
People call this manipulation. They try to break out and they failed. This is the reason we will 
get here. Well, it's what you said um you know 

01:49:22	before the open is going to set up and then it 
will whipsaw take out one side. This is a model like the only things is that I don't get inside 
when they are like so aggressive. So my role is not to predict when they will stop. I just wait 
that they complete this movement. You see all this was a fake. The narrative is still buy. 
Mhm. All this movement gets absorbed one with which the narrative when we break this level. 
We broke this level. No. So we are still buy. If you want to clear the position and for the 
New York session get a better tune of the market, 

01:50:03	you can raise 240 at the contract size. The 
contract and you will it the situation will be a lot clearer. You see? Yeah. Situation now 
it's clear buyers got more than 40 contract here. They are just putting a lock and say 
below this level you don't go like you you try to sell with two I absorbed everything and 
they are recovering all the buy. Now all these sellers need to close the position. Yeah. 
Which then causes a squeeze squeeze like if all these sellers close the position the 
market is jumping and when it gets to this 

01:50:39	level you see the acceleration that we saw 
before but short. Yeah. Like the opposite. In the video that I made with Andrea, all the 
setup that I took are based on this model like squeezing the other part. Yeah. To get the 
acceleration and be immediately break even. Yeah. Yeah. Be able to move at break even really 
fast. Would you say that is one of the necessary skill sets when scalping at this level? Yes. 
like uh being fast and also creating shortcut on your platform. Would you say that you always 
have been like been able to move at speed as 

01:51:22	a trader or is that something you had to train? 
No, we are we are we are human reads. I will be really honest. Sometimes I made big errors like 
um you scale inside the position but you scale you you don't notice that you are scaling not 
by one mini contract a time but we are scaling with five contracts. There is a huge amount on 
NASDAQ like one contract is really heavy and you need to find a good way to scale out and 
you are with like in scalping you need to be fast and sometimes you still make errors. Yeah. 
Um because a lot of the time there will be human 

01:51:54	errors at that point right and then then with 
this volatility look what what the market did as I told you before taking the high taking the 
low and then being at the starting point like in the first 10 minutes of the session we didn't do 
anything we just liquidated the low liquidated the high that's the reason you don't engage before 
now I want to show you these sellers are selling this momentum yeah with zero results Now we are 
getting back to this. When we get back to this, someone will need to cover their position. Yeah. 
When they need to cover the position, the momentum 

01:52:29	will start to build up. So let let's see what 
they do. Still my narrative didn't change. The only thing that could change my narrative is 
the breakout of the level. Still compressed inside here. And we recovered also the major 
delta point here. This means that we are above the strong selling level of the distribution. 
And if we are above here, we are also above the value area high and you remember before the 
reaction that the market had on the value area low. Yeah. Like it completely used this as a pivot 
before collapsing down. Yeah. The same is for up 

01:53:09	like there is an overlap of this area and now 
I think they are so aggressive. If you wanted to be aggressive, these are, you know, this was a 
trade at the low you could have taken, but again, it's like it's not wrong, but it's super super 
aggressive during that time window that really isn't ideal. This one you should not expect 
more than 40% we rate. So, you can take it, but remember you are trying to take a falling knife. 
Yeah, a lot of times you will get cut and you are buying the contrarian momentum. So you are trying 
to stop the price with the big market participants 

01:53:45	after a lot of test and here it's more easy to 
who is winning the battle. If this low gets broken sellers are winning. If this eye gets broken 
buyers are winning the battle. Okay. Now you know who won the battle. Now you can engage. Yeah. 
Don't try to anticipate. This is the main reason why a lot of traders they try to anticipate what 
the market is doing before the market does it. and they get so attached to their narrative that 
they are not willing to change. As I told you, my narrative was long from the beginning. The 
market did an aggressive selloff. I was ready 

01:54:21	to change my narrative and say from this moment, 
if it breaks, I start to search for short. Okay. I'm not marrying my position. I don't care. 
But you have specific levels that invalidate your buys. Yes. Getting excited. It's not so big 
the volatility today to be honest. We are on the 5 minutes. I think they are waiting if there is a 
news of the other of their bombing because yeah so for context over over the weekend today's Monday 
over the weekend the US had bombed Iran in three different sites. We gapped I believe lower on 
ENQ. This is ENQ right? So we gapped lower% the 

01:55:00	gap we recovered the gap uh which we then started 
recording earlier. We then actually sold off and then recovered again. So we're kind of in a range 
at the at this current stage. The squeeze gets completed here. Yeah. Like if they attack this eye 
and all these are squeezed. So here we can expect. So it would be similar to what we were looking 
at over here and we saw this here. We saw this here and they build momentum. Now the squeeze that 
you see in London, it's much less. Yeah. Less the squeeze that you can see here is three times this 
candle. It's pretty aggressive. Mhm. And what is 

01:55:37	it that you do when you are you know active like 
say is in a different setting we're recording and everything even though you're going through the 
same motions but when you are waiting for these 10 15 for the price to get to the right areas for 
you do you still sit and watch or do you have it up maybe some alerts and you're doing other things 
you can put alert on levels now considering that I don't want to transact inside here my first 
alert will be here so just here yeah first alert will be on otherwise you get the temptation Yeah, 
like I I've been I've been tapping and now he's 

01:56:10	controlling himself. Yeah. Uh the temptation to 
to get because here it was really clear that the auction was failing. A lot of aggression and no 
follow up. But it's not your model like you are trying to put some intuition inside the model that 
is already proven to make money. Yes. And would you say that when you first started learning uh 
and to to really look at the market in this way, would you say that you fall guilty sometimes 
in the beginning of as you said trying to use intuition and trying to maybe overpredict and 
over trade almost because you feel like okay I 

01:56:47	I can see these sellers or I can see these buyers 
and you start taking executions outside of your model. Yes, of course you know the Dunning Krueger 
effect. Mhm. when you introduce in your mind a new concept you think you understood everything 
like if I introduce now order flow to a price action trader you will say oh it's so easy like 
there are bolts I take there are no bolts I don't take no it's not like this so in the beginning 
when I introduced it and my model was this and they see aggression and not follow up even if the 
model is not completed and it's not I say but why 

01:57:18	it's free money I jump in and then I say when you 
journal you understand the error that you did so when Your mind is cold. You understand what's the 
real error. Not before. Yeah. They are starting to squeeze. You see, they try to break out the 
eye. A lot of buyers aggression, but the sellers still are pushing down limit orders like punch 
on the wall from the buyers. But the fact that they already reach the eye, it means that the 
sellers are not protecting the level anymore. So for example, let's say if we at this point we 
see buyers let's say we don't close above and is 

01:57:52	our likely scenario from here probably to get to 
here and then see again if buyers or sellers went around. Exactly. Yes. Why? Because this is the 
level of protection and uh the candle is still not closed. So this is still building position. 
But if you start to see rejection this is a level that you can revisit. Now the point is that if you 
enter here where you put your stop loss because you see how much is big this candle if you want 
to be safe you will put your stop loss here. It's not worth it. Yeah of course like it's um that's 
what I was saying when volatility expand you need 

01:58:26	to make a lot of consideration that you were not 
making in long session because one candle in long session you can go short here and protect you here 
and it's okay. Yeah. Look here you need to protect here. It's not worth Yeah. It's just not worth 
the trade. And yet Troy will still take it. Yeah. Because of that as you say that that trying to 
predict or try and say okay this is what's going to happen. It's broken. Yes. Okay. I engage. I 
can start to engage to go here if I have some profit for the day. Yeah. Otherwise no this level 
we stop here. But you see this buy here getting 

01:59:03	no follow through. Y some trader that is getting 
new at order fluency. Maybe I can try a short from here to here. Okay. Where you put your stop loss 
here? Is it worth it? No. Completely. No. You are risking more than you are expected to. Exactly. 
In terms of a position at the high, you know, the one that we're waiting for and looking for. 
Price breaks above. We do our confirmation. We get in. Do you already have a preset uh target in 
mind? Uh or is it something that will depend on once we've broken? So the first target is the the 
one with the highest win rate. It's the previous 

01:59:37	daily high. Okay. So if the previous daily high 
was above, we can go to checking. Now let's check here because they are building. They're building. 
Yeah. And they are preparing the squeeze like as you can see is the first time that a candle can 
accept here. Now if this was happening here, this is a trade. It's happening inside. So 
still if they accept here once this is a breaker test. This is a real breakary test. 
like covering yourself below the aggression and going through the next level and it's still 
1 to three 1 to4 risk-to-reward ratio. Okay, 

02:00:09	you see how much is different watching only 
candle and watching the momentum that created this candle to break out. Yeah. Like you know 
that this is the level if you want to trade and retest you need to protect yourself. Yeah. And 
the first target that makes sense is the level that we considered before. We are not reinventing 
the wheel. Now considering that we still didn't reach the high. I can go here and mark up the 
previous daily high. We have a lot of room. You see if this is the first target, we have a 
huge risk to reward. If it breaks here and test, 

02:00:40	it's 1 to 10, 1 to 20. Now sell is trying to 
stop back in. Yeah. Mhm. Failing. Failing. So let's recap what happened. The narrative was 
long from the beginning. Yeah, before getting us the opportunity to be right, the market took the 
low. Why? He revisit deep discount area. Then he validated the first level of squeeze. A good 
squeeze is when you approach the level and you see aggression and at the same time you see follow 
up from price. This is a good squeeze. Yeah. These sellers are forced to close position here and 
what they will create more and more momentum. 

02:01:25	Yeah. Okay. when price did come down here because 
obviously we're recording this and we're live and what are your thoughts like what's going through 
your head? Do you feel when price is down here like oh you know I I I was thinking like no no I 
was thinking to be honest that you will break the law and I was already preparing my mind for the 
narrative to be short for the day. I only start to change my mind when all these sell bubbles pop 
with this buy. Yeah. And I see that all this have zero effort that one. So I I trace this and I 
validated this is a low volume node. It means 

02:02:03	that there is not a lot of transaction here. The 
first transaction is this level where there is a huge delta on by volume. Yeah, this is exactly 
what stopped price this bunch of information profile low volume node aggression and lock in 
from buyers is something that can validate. But as I told you I never told you I will go long from 
here. Yeah, because it's just too risky. Like you can get lower. Now, this one was the only position 
that I told you if you are a breakout traders and you want to take, you can take this position 
and just trail your stop below your bubbles. 

02:02:37	Okay? And take if you were to buy there, where 
would your stop be? Under the candle low. If you want to buy here, your stop loss can be below 
the Okay. So, it's really aggressive. Like, let's say that the market just test this movement. 
Okay. Mhm. and your stop loss can be below the big orders. Yeah. So, it's a stop loss of $200 to 
make 600. It's one to It's not bad. Yeah. But it's still a position created by market noise. Yes. 
Is still not my setup. Still in the ranges. For sure. There will be some order flow trader that is 
profitable doing this. Yeah. But I will never do 

02:03:15	this because the probability that the market with 
the volatility of New York session will get back here and do this move movement. Yeah. And create 
just a week then you are right on your position. But maybe it creates a week is really high. So 
in this case we were lucky. It fell to the to the pip it rejected and when if this breaks the 
low we are already zero risk. Exactly. So you are fast. You are really reasoning fast. But if I had 
to advise to a friend would I use this model? No. because it's it's a lot of stress. Imagine that in 
one minute on in five minutes you have to trail on 

02:03:50	the next block you need to be really fast. Imagine 
risky $5,000 on the position. Very true. Yeah. You need gut. But when the the range of the New York 
session is clear and you have a breakout of the compression, you have data supporting this to 
the point that there are a lot of studies about u initial initial breakout. Mhm. Like you know 
the model initial breakout when mark um New York American equities break out the low or the high of 
the New York opening there is a huge probability that they will continue. So I'm using a structural 
inefficiency of the market. Yeah. Just timing it 

02:04:30	better than usual traders because I have order 
flow but I'm not reinventing the wheel. Of course is nothing exceptional about it. And this is the 
fourth time that in this timeline we come back to the level that I told you and we still reject 
sellers zero result. Buyers aggressive new auction if it breaks this low risk zero. Yeah. Like it's 
incredible to witness. Now what do you think to the the term or statement that people make in 
terms of buy low, sell high? Because in this case what we're buy low, sell high. It's uh I'm totally 
opposite to it. That's what I'm thinking cuz I was 

02:05:09	thinking like at the low there where we you know 
I would look at and I'm sure a lot of other people would be like oh you put it long that would be 
a great place to buy but as you say that yes you could but on the most chances no wait you can if 
you are like uh uh if you know the fair value of the asset like if I would be doing this for a 
car that I already know the market price. Yeah, that that is stable the market price. I can buy 
low and create my business around it. But market there is not too high of a price for one asset. 
Yes. Because the asset price change constantly, 

02:05:44	you know. So is by law low compared to what 
exactly? Low compared to option flow. It makes sense. Low compared to order flow. There is no 
law. You are buying high. I will never sell this movement. You see what it's doing now? This one 
is already zero risk. Yeah. Okay. Some minutes now starting to get interesting for sellers because 
we are reaching what the level that we mark out 4 hours ago and is still holding. Mhm. What would 
you expect you would you expect price to or would you want price to break through aggressively 
or would you actually not mind if price reaches 

02:06:22	the level, sells off a bit and then breaks uh 
thereafter? was like the the prime like the ideal scenario. I expect the sellers to get destroyed 
as what I told you from the beginning. I expect aggressive market participant to step in as soon 
as we reach this high. A little bit of pullback and then going uh going aggressive as I told you 
by the first 15 to 20 minutes of the session the direction is clear and it's exactly 20 minutes for 
me. The direction is clear. Yeah. First position was breakout trades to get the high but you are 
still in line with statistic distribution. Why? 

02:07:02	Because you are getting a movement. Yeah. When a 
level gets broken supported by volume and you are getting out your position before the level. Yes. 
So you are not trying to you see if we keep the target to the high it's already rejecting. Maybe 
now we does a whips and then explode. Exactly. was amazing to see especially for the fact that 
okay we didn't take this position because didn't fit the playbook didn't fit the we don't have the 
house money from trading earlier for example to take the risk and the that's I think so important 
to highlight because a lot of traders out there 

02:07:34	think you have a bias anything that fits that bias 
you take so in this case for example you you let's say you came in long and you would take a long you 
try to take a long at the low there you try and take a long there you try any long that's possible 
you try and take right in reality you have your playbook. It doesn't matter what your bias is. 
As long as that playbook hasn't presented itself, you do nothing right on your hands. I think they 
will get a lot of value from conceptwise from these trades because this is explaining exactly 
sure it was beautiful cuz even that I would say 

02:08:08	that that's not the it's not the worst trade in 
the world, right? It's it's with the bias. It's one to three in three minutes like it's worth it. 
Just depends on your playbook. Yeah. all. Yeah, it depends who you play with. That's what I'm saying 
though. It's It's incredible to be able to see. Okay, we had a bias. Here's a trade opportunity. 
Played out beautifully even with the explanation as well in real time, which is most important. Um, 
yeah, it's phenomenal to see and we're excited to see how we continue to push through. Now, um, 
what we should expect here is revisiting this 

02:08:39	area. Why? Aggressive buyers failed, not holding 
failed. We knew exact we placed our target exactly where we should expect a reaction. Now there are 
two question. First question is how much deep will be this retracement. Yeah. Second question is 
we want to be in a long position if we get back here. No. Why? Because it's still not clear the 
dealing till these big boys don't fail and says because the good edge is that if this big boys 
gets broken. Yeah. This needs to close position and if all these dealing regions getting in suffer 
we are skyrocketing high and you will say how is 

02:09:22	it possible that we are skyrocketing high if 
we have a situation like this from global macro perspective that's the good part about order 
flow you the market already includes all the information possible you need to read what the 
market is telling you not putting the preconcept of no it will not do this because there is that 
no your role is only to read the data the market itself the market itself there is no better mentor 
than market so is it the case normally then so we'll see at this point this is a previous auction 
where sellers had won and in this case because 

02:09:59	we've seen buyers try to step in fail get absorbed 
we then would expect the previous auction to be revisited to see who's going to win that battle 
and essentially it's a constant flow of what is this as you say expens expensive or is this cheap? 
Is this where buyers are are happy to transact out and win the transaction or sellers? And therefore, 
we constantly have the next play ready. The next play ready according. So if for example instead 
of us the buyers failing here and we actually won and we broke above. Mhm. We would then as you 
said there would probably be a squeeze. Yes. How 

02:10:35	would you let's say if that was to take place? 
Mhm. Where would you look to try and enter if because a squeeze let's say a squeeze takes place 
that' be quite aggressive right it will be quite aggressive it will be with a lot of big trades 
inside I will plot my profile search for the first low volume node jump in with a really tight 
stop loss and get the explosion okay got you and this way you can get really fast one two three one 
to five if you have five art for the day you are done what you need it's a beautiful trade and the 
good part is that if You take two stop loss. The 

02:11:09	stop loss is so small that you can afford to take 
three or four stop loss. Yeah. And you on average what do you look to risk? Does it depend on the 
day or the account that you're trading? Usually I I risk 0.25% per trade because I trade personal 
account. Yeah. And uh in the Robins cap I reach till 0.5% per trade. Uh sometimes when I get above 
100% of return I get to 1%. Gotcha. But I will my role is always keeping draw down low because 
commission it's really heavy there. Yes. Like 600 execution per quarter can cost you 10 20% of 
the account. So it's like you don't need only to 

02:11:50	make profit. You need also to repay commission. So 
it's just not not uh convenient to execute. What's happening here? We're seeing the buyers trying to 
trying to break this level. Yeah. They are getting aggressive to the eye. What does it mean that they 
are willing to pay higher price? Yeah. For this asset. Yeah. So is it too expensive to buy? No. 
Because if it was too expensive, aggressive buyers will not participate here. So it means that still 
my narrative is buyer. Even if I didn't break this level, I already know what to expect for the day. 
Already know. And we are getting ready for the 

02:12:23	squeeze. The squeeze will be present here. Look. 
There you have it. This is the squeeze. Now what can we expect? Really fast analysis. This is the 
bunch of aggressive trades that are populating this movement. Y I will not plot the profile 
because this is all low volume node. Yep. They didn't transact efficiently. So the first position 
that you can take here is protected by this area. Okay. So if this candle close and it's only five 
minutes uh it can either give us a follow through so break of the eye and we get a retracement 
because remember we never take the first drive. 

02:13:05	Okay. Because it can be a fake out. You're on 
the confirmation. Yeah. Yeah. See it can be a fake out. It can be absorbed and snapped back. 
I'm getting too excited. I'm like yeah execution. Let's get let's get in here. But this is why 
you're the professional and I'm the podcaster. But it is incredible honestly uh to see you know 
play by play uh we can have a position here if it breaks the low you can get the first position of 
risk here targeting a one to2 so we are risking 6 600 to make potentially double 1,200 and if we 
want we can also trail our stop loss to the to 

02:13:49	the high and the high is a huge risk to reward if 
it achieves leaves it. But our rule now is to put our stop loss to risk zero as soon as possible. 
Of course. Yeah. This so this long executes if the high gets broken. Yeah. This execution can be 
on by stop like buy stop. Yeah. If it uh breaks the high you can be inside the position. Now this 
this makes sense because we are protected by all these big orders you know. So as soon as this week 
gets taken you are just inside and you are covered here. Why? Because look look what's happening 
here. If this okay we are inside in this position. 

02:14:27	We are risking $650. If these sellers are getting 
aggressive and we are getting anniated we want to be out as soon as possible because it means we 
are wrong. Yeah. At the same time if we see these sellers getting completely absorbed by buyers in 
continuing up doesn't fail the stop and we are if we go above would you say that it would uh would 
it cause a squeeze because especially because of the size of understood how it works. Yes. So if we 
break above now for example and we continue higher in terms of trailing your stop would you be then 
trailing it beneath? It's not so difficult. No, 

02:15:03	it's not. It is so interesting because as I 
was saying to you earlier like I think a lot of people have a huge misconception with they 
think order flow it's hard. Yeah. Just order their flow is reading an alphabet. You need 
to learn letters and then that's it. But it's really strange what's happening here because it's 
not common that you have a breakout and you don't test. They are leaving a huge low volume node. 
The only thing I'm afraid because consider that we are now in the position is that in the test 
of the low volume node they will spike out but 

02:15:33	we we will take multiple position in this case. 
Yeah. So they are pushing the eye. What does it mean if they are pushing the eye and make another 
drive? This big boy needs to close the position because he's losing. And if this boy needs to 
cover himself, the squeeze can get interesting. See, just analyzing balls, not price. 
These balls look just a game of balls. When they start overlapping, it kind 
of looks like ICT's enigma, you know, like this is how this is how it's really going 
on. Yeah. But now the algorithm is saying that 

02:16:11	we are going to get long. Mhm. It's not orderful. 
It sound good. It is incredible though. Honestly, you can only understand where is price because 
you watch this line. You see this? Exactly. Exactly. It's so interesting honestly. But I'd 
love to I do wonder, you know, what the audience are thinking at this stage. You know, what they 
would feel trading this live, especially when we were down at the low at the open when you 
said that we'll see a shakeout. I wonder how many people would probably be looking to either 
uh short, probably been stopped out already and 

02:16:45	trying to revenge trade or get back in or like 
what would that look like, you know, for for a lot of people cuz I can imagine down there a lot of 
people probably would have been shorting shorting shorting expecting, you know, a follow through 
down but then, you know, especially after the gap's been filled as well, right? Because a lot 
of people would assume be gap filled in London, we're going to then continue lower, right? Uh 
but as we can see but in what's good about what's what's happening like the sellers the sellers are 
getting completely destroyed then soon we have the 

02:17:22	incredible soon we have the we can put the stop 
loss at break even we have a long way to go still. So at this stage would you have scale uh moved the 
stop loss beneath the the red uh the red bubble there? There's only one reason I will not do it 
and they will be happy to take a stop loss if it snap back at me because there is low volume low 
volume node like you they can push a spike really fast and they get liquidated in a really good 
position. Got you. Yeah. Like this position it's only one contract can give you 1,000. Look how 
much it's pushing. Like that makes sense. Yeah. 

02:17:56	No, we got we enter here and we got one lazer 
green line. You cannot expect anything better as a trader because you are just psychologically it's 
way better than being included in this mess. No, very true. Yeah, very very true. It's time for 
us to put the risk to zero. So now So now even if it comes to low volume node, it's fine because 
you've taken zero and you have a chance to reenter that. Yeah. Now you can play this game in a lot 
of ways. You can scale in again. Uh you can put this stop loss to break even and use this amount 
of profit to open another position because you 

02:18:38	have another lock in here. What does it mean lock 
in? This seems like the master card logo but it's sellers getting aggressive. Yeah. And buyers 
getting more aggressive than that. Who is fall? You see they are willing. Now when I tell you 
what does it mean buy low sell high if they are willing to pay a higher price to push the price 
down. There is no discount. There is no premium. Yeah. Like it's it's just stupid the concept 
that they are trying to push to the audience because here the only thing the market is telling 
you is that buyers are willing to pay more to buy 

02:19:13	NASDAQ. That's it. Yeah. As simple as that. You 
don't need seven screen. You don't need a huge amount of tools. You are we are just watching the 
real nature of the market. Orders not candles. So if you were to add there, would it be a case 
where you want a close and then a revisit? Yes, in this case you will take profit because it's 
already like half. It's like 1 to 1.5 when it was here. So you can just close and use the profit 
to take another trade on the test. Gotcha. We are not doing this this model because this low 
volume node scares me. Yeah. And I'm really I 

02:19:51	don't want to say I'm sure because I hope it 
will go good but I know my my chicken I know my NASDAQ and usually at the session it's just 
give the first drive. Yeah. Pull back. Yeah. And create but we can just now we are risk that's 
the reason also I got aggressive with risk zero because we can take it another trades otherwise 
use the profit on the first one to take another one that will be even better. What is telling 
us the market now? Just analyzing raw data, the buyers at the top are not getting accepted. So 
it's getting expensive. Yeah. If it get expensive, 

02:20:28	we should start to see some sellers here. Yeah. 
And if we see sellers and they win the battle, we are [ __ ] up to the point that if these 
levels gets broken, we can also go to stop in profit of€1,000. Mhm. Not 1,000, like 800. and say 
if it goes bad we use this profit to make another trade. Gotcha. Yeah. But the major movement of the 
day we took it in the first 20 minutes. That's the major movement of the day. The break then you can 
play it longterm. Yeah. And if you play longterm you have 1 to 10 risk-to-reward but you get a 
lower win rate. Of course. Or you can just say 

02:21:04	give my cash session is done. Are you able in uh 
in futures as part of this are you able to like partial your trades? Of course. Yes. Yeah. Yes. 
Yes. So, is that something is that something you sometimes do? Let's say in this example, it's a 
good one to be fair. Uh would you for example, you had multiple contracts on and you're in 
this position. Would you say considering that I go heavy and I go with multiple contracts 
when I see this rejection, I would already take out half of the contracts because I'm risk 
free. Okay. Exactly. Yeah. I can take profit and 

02:21:35	I can continue to scale in if I want. Okay. 
I don't like when the market gets weak. So, I will take out here. But education wise I want 
the trade to get completed. Either we are stopped out at break even either we go to take profit. 
I don't want to create additional difficulty of trade management that this advance. Yeah. 
Because even then with trade management it's quite personal part of the like it's a big part of 
the but when it comes to say the high of previous day is that something then let's say you've taken 
half off would that be your next sort of target or 

02:22:11	if let's say price goes to you know one to three 
or four and then shows similar where we're getting a bit of weakness you want to know everything give 
me all the secrets so the point is you when I told you I will scale out it's exactly because when 
you see this the step is aggressive sellers. Yeah, you you coded the algorithm. Uh the 
next step is aggressive sellers. Now, if aggressive sellers gets recovered, yeah, this 
was funny. If aggressive sellers gets recovered, we should expect another explosion up the second 
squeeze. Yeah. Okay. So, let's go back to your 

02:22:51	question. Um like cuz bearing in mind, right, 
the each one of these is 40. You set it to 40 contracts, right? 40. But these big balls, maybe 
it's 100. Exactly. That's what I was saying. Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Uh these are big boys. Okay. So I 
would like these big boys to be squeezed or to get back to the low volume node. Yeah. So for 
example, we were at the high there in real time or or you know, if we weren't in this setting, 
you probably would have taken half off. Yes. Let's say price comes back to break even on that 
trade, no problem. But then you're going to look 

02:23:23	at the reaction from the low volume node. Is it 
again a confirmation based? Of course. Like again, I if this one goes to half profit and half break 
even, I would use half the profit that I made to wait for the trades there because I'm pretty 
sure that if we get back to the low volume node, we get aggressive buyers, we are going to run to 
the high. So you can just bear in mind where did this get to? It's got to about 800. You say €800? 
Yeah, like 800. But I'll fit 400. Exactly. But now it's easy for people at home to maybe think, oh, 
this is only one contract. Exactly. Yeah. That's 

02:23:56	what I was going to say. So like, you know, you 
make that 10 contracts for example. So you would have taken 4,000. 4,000 within a few minutes. 
That's the point. The more the account size, the more you feel confident to get continuous 
profit for the day. Yeah. And then if you want to scale in, you scale in with the profit. This 
is you anticipated what I wanted to say to you like how I did this performance in the world 
trading cup is building profit for the day, building profit for the day, building profit for 
the day and in directional days I risk for example 

02:24:26	in 10 trades the profit that I made for the day 
and you get a huge percentage of course but you are only risking profit of the day. Yeah. If 
the day gets close this profit is locked in it's equity. It's not more profit. You cannot risk it. 
So the next day reset reset. Yeah. Yeah. And if you think about what's the concept of this, when 
the model goes well, you take risk. Yeah. Because the model is respecting what you're saying. 
If the model goes back, ready for the squeeze, huh? Ready for the squeeze coming? Uh sellers 
aggressive here. No follow through. Yeah. So we 

02:25:00	need this eye. If this eye gets broken, we 
go here. Yeah. Done. Uh what was I saying? That you build your position with multiple 
scalps and uh this means that when the market condition is favorable to you, you make a lot of 
money. Yeah. When the market condition is bad, you take the first two or three stop loss and 
you are out. Done. Yeah. One trade the next day, everything covered. I have a maximum stop- loss 
for the day like in percentage term that is 2%. So when I say to people this day I took eight stop 
loss I only lost 2%. Exactly. That's what they 

02:25:38	don't understand. They see the time maybe they 
risking 3% per stop loss. Of course it's a lot but that's not how you deal with risk management. 
And what's important to highlight as well as we were talking about contracts and you know if 
you had more contracts this would have been X amount. What's important to highlight with that is 
that that's not where you start right. You start with the low. Yeah. Micro. you build over time 
and and I think people hear over time and they automatically assume that's a long time but it's 
all perception right so like if it takes you two 

02:26:06	to three to four years to really start to build 
a position size up and your confidence and your skill isn't that worth being able to make four 
five $10,000 in a day right in a day yes but then don't hear that line and think oh yeah that's you 
that's incredible I can do that ASAP and whatever it's the three to five years of dedication and 
and hard work and really intricate detail that then allows you to have that skill set. But it's 
like a lot of people aren't willing to sacrifice and understand that. And as I said, this is a 
this is a a strategy and a playbook that is truly 

02:26:41	for trade actual traders, you know, not for people 
who like the idea of trading, if that makes sense. Yes, I totally agree with you. And also like I 
know it's easier to believe in the fairy tales of the Metatrader bot that makes money for you when 
you sleep or just the signal service that is able to put money to put food on your table when you 
don't do anything. But that's not the reality. and uh message to the audience. Trust only people that 
give you some sort of verification or even better live analysis. If you can live trading, if you can 
track record and understand if they are doing what 

02:27:26	they are saying they do. Yeah. Because there is a 
big difference between people that make money with the market and people that make money pretending 
to trade the market like with service connected to them. In this case, you see they revisit again 
the big traits. Yeah. No follow through. Going back to the now I remove a little bit because 
I cannot really see price. So let's remove it. So the message I want to give to them they he 
didn't take out us on break even on the second position but we took out position here half of 
the position. You see how much this level it's 

02:28:02	important and this level the market is using to 
pivo. This is not a case. This is when buyers decided that it was too expensive to continue 
buying. So this is the cap of the auction. The Mustang got too much expensive for us. Yeah. If 
they are changing their narrative when we will see another candle, we can continue to trail our 
stop in profit. Like it's not ringing the wheel. I will keep this visual for now without big orders 
because otherwise I cannot see where is our break even. And here is our premium setup. If we are 
willing to go back and cover the low volume node, 

02:28:42	we will use half of the profit that we made to um 
strike up even with one contract. This can be a $4,000 trades if we wait for the eye. Yeah. But 
we need to stay here till evening because I think the volatility I can see it's it was big in the 
beginning but now it's drying up. So let's see. Let's see at least if we reach the target without 
taking out the other position at break even. That other trade that we discussed in terms of outside 
of your playbook and some traders might have it in their playbook. Um and you said though with 
that trade it makes sense to target the you 

02:29:21	know the the ceiling that we had at the time. 
Yes. Exactly. Because you don't know if it's going to break higher. Would it be if someone 
was taking that setup or would would that be a setup you would take if you had already traded 
in the day made some profits or even then it would be because it's it's not a bad setup. It's 
a good setup. Just let's would you take the full setup out here or would it if in that case you had 
multiple contracts? Is that another one where you would say half off leave? I do something really 
smart. Okay. I take the setup out here but I'm 

02:29:51	ready to open it back with the profit I made 
if it breaks. Okay. Okay. So, you're able to I don't take the risk of indecision here. Okay. 
Yeah. I I bring the money in my account then I'm willing to put the money on the table. Yeah. If 
I have a confirmation like it makes more sense. I tried what you say to keep it. Yeah. But seven 
times it snap back. You get a break and you say [ __ ] I should I I can include it start the day 
at 3 hour and I let the market take out everything is preparing the squeeze. Yeah. So all those red 
orders here are right now under water. We take 

02:30:24	that high. We should squeeze up. You're getting 
good. Teacher being prepared. We have a great What can we expect? Buyer said the eye. Yeah. 
The auction got expensive now. More expensive. They are willing to pay higher price for it. So 
absorbed. Absorbed. You can put in stop in profit if you want. I will not do it because the test 
here it's really probable to happen. Yeah. But we took a really exponential move. You see almost 
zero draw down like from when we entered there was zero to non draw down like we enter in this 
candle it continue again seller trying to step in 

02:31:05	in a parabolic move in this particular here. Now 
is this now the level we would hope would hold? Yes. Yeah. This if you want to be conservative the 
down there. Yeah. down there because this is the protection level of the sellers. Why we saw this 
exponential move even someone will think we are expensive. Why? Because these sellers are closing 
position and this creating even more momentum. Now again same situation sellers 
aggressive buyers that needs to decide if they want to protect this level 
and continue to be aggressive here. Mhm. 

02:31:49	Now we are reaching 22 round number. Yes, 
this is a really important number. Price will accumulate or distribute around this level. 
So you can also decide to if it breaks this high with aggression, you can also take the second 
position with a really tight stop loss. So if it goes bad, you take another $600 or $700, but 
at least you are protecting yourself. So if we tap this eye, the stop loss goes here. Yeah. 
So our stop loss our stop loss goes here. So we make more than the first position, but still 
we are protected. Yes. And then someone can say 

02:32:29	what if it goes if it test and then goes up. Okay, 
we are protected on the second one. It's another 7 $700 here because if this eye doesn't hold and 
the market collapse, I don't want to give back to the market all the profit that we made. 
We made an amazing zero draw down entry here because this is in consideration that that's our 
target. So then the it's a negative risk-to-reward to allow us to go back. Exactly. Exactly. 
I'm not willing to give to the market all this money back. Yeah. and see our sellers are 
starting to participate on the top, I don't like 

02:33:00	it. I expect a a squeeze that will bring us 
to target. But if is this level gets broken, I I I have too much profit to give back. 
It's not worth for me. Mhm. So our stop loss now it's I will show you this low. Okay. 
And I can see that it's not easy to break this high because you have to consider that it's 
around number. Buyers are getting aggressive again buying the top. If this auction fail, I 
think we will revisit the low low volume node all the way. Yeah. Yeah. All the way. So we can 
have another position with made 400 on the first, 

02:33:38	700 or 600 on the second. We are floating 
on out. Yeah. Totally out on the position. Let's remove everything. It's important to highlight as well. So 
at this point maybe roughly $1,000 $1,100 um in ter in total profits. Yeah. And bear in 
mind because I think social media causes a a slight problem in the trading space where they 
think $1,100 is not a lot of money. Bear in mind that's,100 in roughly about half an hour with one 
contract. With one contract. But not even just 

02:34:15	that though. Even $1,100 in a single day Mhm. is 
incredible because if you're trading for a month and on average you whatever 50% win rate whatever 
it may be you're still coming out with a very good yearly salary in a month almost. Yes. Right. And 
that's incredible and that's like position number one. That's like as you scale in your trading 
journey that's how it should look. Now, I know it's so easy with social media to assume you need 
to be making a $100,000 a month every single month or multiple hundreds of thousands. And that is 
possible, right? And there are traders doing that, 

02:34:50	but they didn't start that way. They go through 
the process step by step. Look at the precision of the reversal point. We saved all this money 
that the market want to give to get back like from here. This is I want to show you something and I 
will make another prediction that is not a trade. Okay. But is this where the market will reverse 
this delta from here to here it's not worth the trade. Yeah. Because here it's full of big trades 
not having a follow-up. I expect that from here we get all the way back from here. Mhm. And we can 
use this two $500 trades to make another one to 

02:35:32	three. Now let's say if we take another two trades 
for the day. One to three. $500 series, it's another $3,000 only using the profit. Worst case 
scenario, we close break even of the day. Yeah. Like the reason traders are unprofitable is they 
try to get the home run. So maybe they get this breakout and they all till the top without taking 
partial without you can never go broke by taking partial like you you are sitting on profit for the 
day. And in this case as well like there's nothing in between that you would look for. You would 
only wait for price to come back to that higher 

02:36:09	probable area. Let's see. I will exactly tell you 
where I expect a reaction considering that still the momentum by I didn't saw the big picture, but 
the momentum buy is amazing. But let's get the the whole picture. It's incredible though because it 
shows you when you're dissecting price when you're logged in. I I lose the conception of time really. 
I I was thinking that it was 20 minutes that we were there. It did feel to be fair to you. It did 
feel like that. Yeah, this is a huge volume. Huge low volume note. Yeah, you can see like it's 
a squeeze. It's very So I will not engage in 

02:36:44	other trades here. Just the first trade that I 
would watch is here. But watching the momentum, I don't think uh we will go back. So you can 
just continue to adapt to the position using the profit. If you want, we can continue to see it. 
Can one minute and see what big boys are doing. So my take and this is against the probability 
is that this is a wall. Okay. Okay. So this is the trade that you never need to do. But if 
I need to consider a trade, this is what I'm afraid about. Okay. Of that happen. This 
is the reason I took out the buy position 

02:37:25	before. Gotcha. Round number. Seller getting 
aggressive. Buyers not having a follow through. Was there any of this slowdown as well? Was 
that take that into account as well? Yes, because this one it's compression again. Okay. The 
market getting back inside compression. Usually it's a visit of the low. Okay. Uh now let's 
see what cumulative volume delta is saying. This is an important information that we are 
putting in for the first time here. Mhm. And this the cumulative volume pressure of the market 
visualizing candlestick. You see that it's short 

02:38:02	down here. Yeah, this is an information because 
the squids was supported but then we started to distribute. Yes. Again all this by movement no 
follow up. Yeah. Divergence. M this divergence is significant because it means that there is 
something big here. So two scenario either it breaks and we take another continuation trades 
that is amazing for us but I know this asset and I think that we are going to revisit from 
here either this low or this low volume then we take even better trades. Yeah, this is a 
pattern that I have seen a lot of times. Four 

02:38:49	consecutive weeks every week taking out the high 
but not creating new value. If there is a big buy trades here a collapses is soon. Of course, it's 
not a trade because we are counter trend on it. Let's see if the doesn't get old. 
I'll tell you that it doesn't go. Yes. Yes. It's this one. Big trades, no 
follow through. Yeah. Sellers building the narrative. Cumulative volume 
delta going down. Here we go. Would you say uh do you only trade NASDAQ and 
Q? NASDAQ because uh it's a lot of information 

02:39:33	to deal with. Yeah. I tried one time with NASDAQ 
and crude oil, but I was a therapist. I need DP psychologist at the end of the uh but would you 
say that also though even though yes it's a lot of information by really tuning into one asset such 
as NQ yeah it's the the cheat code like understand like you just said I've seen I know this pair this 
was feeling like this one is the intuition part it's a counter trend trades I will never take 
it but we took from the bottom to the eye and we exit at the top we saved the delta profit that 
was here that if I was using my ego I will say No, 

02:40:09	we go to target. Yeah, because this is my target. 
But this capacity to adapt to market behavior here in this amount of error, we took an explosion 
that is five times more. It's not easy to time the market in this way. If these big trades protect 
and break the high, we have another buy. Mhm. So, we can again jump on the train. And the problem 
with if you're trying to say long and then short is that the real bias is still long. But let's say 
if this comes up now and and you get break even or stop loss. A lot of people's psychology 
is that they will still focus on the short 

02:40:48	cuz that's the one they lost. Yes. Instead of 
realizing where the original bias is by taking this lowquality setup that yeah okay might be 
might pull through might be able to make some good profit from whatever it may be. The problem 
is our mindsets get fixed on that bias then and that happens to a lot of people. I think a lot 
of people let's say coming into this session as a good example coming into this session they did 
the same market analysis you did long bias price shot down they switch to short they take a loss. 
Yes. But then the problem is they don't switch 

02:41:17	back or recognize their mistake and they stick 
on the loss and they stick on the short and they keep trying to short all the way up. They marry 
their trades and then they end up in, you know, blowing their challenge, blowing their account, 
taking a heavier loss than they're meant to when in reality they had to, you know, you've 
done your, it's like you said earlier, right? When you're at war, you don't make the 
changes, right? You don't make change when you are fighting. Yeah. Like the changes are made 
in the tent with generals and planning the war 

02:41:45	up front. Mhm. In this case, it's building a 
goodby setup. Yeah. Huge amount of buy here. Watching the narrative here. I don't think 
we will retrace back. Look where it tapped in. Low volume node. Now what we need to be 
back in the trade? We need a breakout of this high. Yeah. So the next set uh buy stop. Uh 
no, I want a full candle close. Okay. On this one. So risky. What's the reason for that one? 
Because we're already quite high. Because the bias is clear. The bias is clear. The target 
is still not taken. The momentum is big and 

02:42:23	the interesting is big. Like this candle, this um 
uh big order is bigger than all this area. Okay, these traders are getting squeezed. So if we break 
this high, we test this area. I will target for another $12,000 trade getting to 22062. This 
will be the trade. But you see how much fast you need to put your ego aside and say this was 
the narrative that I was building. It didn't break the high but it broke the low. Yeah. So it can 
be still a retracement to the low volume node. What I need the trade is valid as soon 
as we close with a one minute candle 

02:43:14	full body candle above this where we were 
failing. Yeah, where we were failing. Even better if in the move up there is a big 
trade cell that gets destroyed like here. Let's see. And how long have you been trading this way? This 
way it's around four years that I use order flow more than price action. Before I started before 
four years I started to get only the trigger from order flow. Now I'm full order flow like I 
use price action only as a proxy and a result of 

02:43:55	volume. Yeah. like I you you see I always compare 
the volume with the result that is providing and um but the learning curve is still like 20% of 
what you can understand with this. So I still am one 20% of the real power of order flow I mastered 
like I still need to to get better sometimes because I think there especially nowadays with 
machine learning and neural network you can put this kind of data in an algorithm that really 
helps you to remove all the noise. Mhm. And um I think in the area of artificial intelligence, 
understanding deeply this data and using AI to 

02:44:35	just get a better um risk management or position 
management, journaling all your trades. This is an idea for Omar. Like using artificial intelligence 
for the journal is something that can really step up the game a lot. And it's incredible how much 
when you have 2,500 sample also a small change in risk management change the curve of the equity 
line. Yeah. Like you can go parabolic or you can go stable or you can go like this small change. 
So the strategy it's 30%. Let's say 33%. 33% is the mindset the trader that is behind and that it 
can stay calm when it's not his setup or playbook 

02:45:17	presenting. Yeah. The other trend 33% is the 
risk management part. Definitely it's a huge part. Definitely. Yeah, that's something that um I 
did a round table with uh you know verified seven and eight figure traders Zuma was there as well 
and that was one thing that seemed to stand out is that once traders had gotten the strategy down 
right had their playbook and then they have the psychology at this point they have consistency a 
huge portion of that change in P&L is tweaking the risk management by really mastering and focusing 
on that totally. So what are you seeing here then? 

02:45:53	So at this stage obviously we've seen this big 
buyer. We are we are still in a uh buy narrative. Is that that setup that you have mapped out there 
still valid? The the sell the the buy sorry the buy is still valid. Yes. Totally. And uh it's 
still not activated because they need to break the Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. But is is valid. The nar 
the narrative is valid. I was interested in this buy. If it gets bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro 
bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro broken and tested we will keep this narrative. 
Yeah but still we are long. We broke the high 

02:46:23	of the consolidation. So we are in the expansion 
phase that we explained before at this stage where we are now. Anyway, I know obviously it's still 
valid anyway. But if I say you saw some sellers try to step in and they get absorbed just add to 
the confidence. If I see sellers getting absorbed here, it would be amazing because it says look we 
are also heavy on limit order not only aggressive orders because these are execution but if you see 
a sell aggressive not getting a follow through it means that the buyers are also protecting from 
limit order absorbing. So you have two forces 

02:46:58	pushing in the same direction and it's a really 
good trades. Yeah, I'm really optimistic on this one. like it's a long way to go up here, but still 
we are in the dealing range that we want to trade because we still didn't took out the previous day 
previous daily high. Yeah. And would you say as well this compression we're seeing at this high, 
if we were to break higher, it would essentially be another squeeze. So because of that range that 
we've kind of been building here at the high, if we were to break higher, it would be all 
the these sellers and these sellers here Mhm. 

02:47:30	would have to close and there's I think 
there's one in there as well. Yeah. Yeah, but then they would essentially have to close out 
which would then cause us to push towards target more. They will uh get an exponential move of the 
price here. I'm pretty sure about it. But we need to give them a reason to close the trades because 
still now they can be right. Yes. Yes. They are going to be proven wrong if we first break this 
level. But if we approach this ice before so I don't want to lose the trade because if I wait 
here to step in Yeah. I risk that it's another 

02:48:02	explosion like this and we are unfilled. Yes. So 
I will just take a level because when we break this one the probability that we will continue 
high. So our margin of error is small because we are only losing $595. This is half of the profit 
that we already made. Yes. But if it goes good we add another 1,200. So we are sitting on the 
day for $2,200. Just to confirm for everyone, we're not in this trade yet. Yeah. No, no, no. 
Uh when you see this level here, it's long one contract and price takes that low. Mhm. Does 
that you invalid invalid because it means that 

02:48:37	the seller these buyers are not aggressive enough 
to push it up. But can I show you something I need to remove because the narrative that I have is 
really clear on the long and I will explain you why. Let's consider all this compression here. 
Now let's take into account all this area. Okay. Yeah, we are not willing to break the right the 
value area low. Mhm. But we are willing to sit above the P. Yeah. If we are sitting above the P 
consistently, it means that it's an accumulation. Yeah. Not always, but statistically wise, it's 
more probable that we will approach this high. 

02:49:26	Yeah. And if we approach this eye and we spike up, 
these traders are forced to close their position. If they are forced to close the position, we 
experience another catalyst in price that gives us the possibility to to be break even in one 
minute because we enter here, it approach here, it explode here, break even. So it's only 
temporary the $600 loss. Now I want to I want to see if approaching here we have aggressive sellers 
not willing to um not willing to have a reaction like pushing but limit order are absorbing them. 
Let's see how is it going. I want to activate also 

02:50:10	because it's really useful the commumulative 
volume delta in this situation. So what the cumulative volume delta is saying now is that they 
are building momentum down. So we can expect what is called a whipsaw. Okay. Take off the law. But 
as you can see also here consolidation like also here like replicating the same scenario. Mhm. 
In this situation here. Let's see. They say that scalpers don't have patience but a lot. It's 
not it's not like swing but it's a lot of patient to wait for the correct setup. Exactly. Yeah, 
that's true. So I will only use these two signal 

02:50:55	the value area low and I will use the same color 
blue and the value area high that is this one. Okay, then I will cancel this one. There's a 
little bit of delay for connection I think. And um what we will do is we will 
observe when we approach this level, if we approach this level, 
the behavior of the big trades still not participating. Mhm. Still bias control. 
Does this just mean uh No, no, it's live. It's live. just uh I think let me reload but I think it 
works properly. Let's see if there is any change. 

02:51:47	No, it works. Let me check with the phone if 
there is any discrepancy in price but I think no. Oh no, it disappeared. It was only 
temporary. There was delay 5 seconds, 10 seconds the red the mark, but we are 
approaching the high still buyers controlling like if we want to get the horizontal level is 
exactly the one protecting this order. So my stop loss is a little bit too generous. should 
be like this to be honest. Mhm. Exactly $500. This uh price consolidating the way it is 
right now. Is that would you say that's a 

02:52:45	positive thing, negative thing or just neutral? 
It's positive thing because it's most probably a reaccumulation before because the market 
cannot look here. It's skyrocket up. Yep. Without retracing. This is not um efficient 
market exchange. This is inefficiency price action. So this one is necessary if we want 
to reach the top of the day. This one is the market cannot be parabolic. Yeah. Because 
there needs to be interaction like sellers trying to step in. And now if we analyze sellers 
trapped, buyers aggressive, big node on the top, 

02:53:21	possible squeeze. If we break this one, this 
one are forced to close. Mhm. It's a good setup. This one is a good setup. And the good part is 
that we are using profit of the profit. This is psychologically also really convenient for us. So 
you have a 2% limit on loss loss for the day. On the worst case scenario, I lose 2%. That is eight 
trades. Yeah. But doesn't happen often can happen one time every two months. Yeah. So in in in 
this case though like if you were trading at your own desk right now and um so first trade's 
a a win are you taking trades like this trade 

02:54:02	another trade for example would you be taking 
any of those other trades that we discussed uh as well or trying them or is I will take 
the exact same trade if it was on desk the only difference is that I'm with a trackp now 
and I have a mouse that have shortcut so I can just execute faster and also put at break even 
with one shortcut like the execution it's really important like with a laptop it's not the best 
to do scalping but uh yes these are two valid setup the setup that we took before is exactly 
what I would execute in the water in cup if I 

02:54:36	was still participating in it we are approaching 
the high and um exactly at the level I told you so now participating we are waiting for full 
candle because it can be a fake out on the full candle we are in it's one minute chart so 
it's really easy see if you we were in before we would risk the whip saw now what happens if 
the full candle arrives here we cannot have this big stop loss so we will just cover ourself below 
the big trade okay got so let's see how it goes we are still not in. 

02:55:21	So I need to adapt my stop loss. If the candle close even here, we are 
still risking even less 355. But I need to see that it close above this box. Yes. 
If it close inside, I'm not engaging. If it closes inside then closes above the box, 
you're in or it close below. Yeah. So, not in. Okay. But if it now closed above, you 
see why not? Yeah. If it now closed above, I still can consider the trade. But, uh, I 
need to cover myself below this bias. Yes. 

02:56:03	This is potential area accumulation. So, I 
can have a really small stop loss. It's this trade execute. I will participate here. It's $275 
loss. Okay. 20% of what we got for the day. So, are you doing that because that is, 
you know, if we go below that low, the setup is essentially fine anymore. 
Okay. So, it doesn't matter about, oh, you have $600 worth of risk you could use. 
So, give it wider. I'm showing one contract, but if the risk is only $280, I can scaling 
contract like I can bring the risk to $500. So, 

02:56:38	two contracts in this case. I got you. Yes. 
Okay. I understand. Yeah. Let's see. Okay, we are in here. Close of the candle. We are in. We are 
risking $260 to make potential 1,100. It's one to five. One to five and a halfish. Yeah. Five and a 
half. The good part is that when we approach this, if we break, we are risk free immediately. 
If we break that, yeah, we break this one, you see the catalyst. Okay. We go risk free. Got 
you. and like some seconds and we go risk free. So now you'd be risk free. 
Yes, the risk is free. It's 

02:57:23	it can be below this aggression candle but it's 
still risky. I will still not go risk-f free because I think we will test this level. I will 
take the risk to take a loss on this one. Yeah, you can go risk free when you see 
candle accepting the high. Yeah, this one is still not accepting the 
high and the risk is that it test then skyrocket up and you are out of 
your position and it moves too fast. No, it's again test. You see what I saved 
does the upper top of the range. Yeah. Yeah, 

02:58:02	I saved the fact that I will get liquidated 
if I go too fast risk free. And you can say you can re-enter. Yes, but what if 
now it explode? It's too fast. Yes, it's too fast. Now, when we get a full money 
candle up, Yeah. we can get risk-free. Okay. You're getting anxious. Yeah, 
we're dry. We're getting We're getting good by the end of this be 
a whole different trader. That's it. But be honest, is it more clear than price 
action or Yeah, it is. It is. Uh it's way more 

02:58:39	clear. Like I said, the one of the most clearest 
orderflow breakdowns we've done so far, for sure. And to be able to do it live as well and see it 
live is incredible. Um, and I'll tell you that, you know, the platform's been incredible as well 
because, as I said, previous ones I've seen, it's it feels very overwhelming as someone who 
doesn't use orderflow, while this one you can incorporate a lot of this information quite 
cleanly, especially like you had the volume profile with the delta, and then you have uh, you 
know, the orders being shown as well, the large 

02:59:08	orders being shown, and it all feels quite clean. 
And the the beauty is you can just click a button, hide them off, put them back on. Yeah. So you see 
it's not it's a fail this is a failed deduction like every time it approach the high and get back 
our probability that we will get a stop loss gets higher. Okay. Okay. So if we approach again and it 
gives me the ability to put my stop loss to break even here I will do because the setup is getting 
the more time the the weaker the weaker the weaker a good setup create an explosion here. Okay. 
So yes, there are these big orders protecting, 

02:59:42	but the probability that it will just spike out 
and liquidate me is getting higher and higher. And that's exactly what happened. So 
how much we lost on this one? $255. So the ability to be able to spot this here 
saves you to put a stop loss like the beginning we wanted to do here down here. Yeah. No, 
it's a half the risk. Let's adopt the the narrative. We are in profit of 750 for the day 
because we lost two $250 on this one. What can we do? If this big order gets again absorbed, we 
can engaged. But we need to see again aggression 

03:00:25	of the market participants. We can take a 
final position of other $500 to target for either the eye of the day either one to two one 
to three riskto-reward. What happened here? Why we have this movement? Aggressive buyers no follow 
through. Mhm. Getting back in sellers locking the movement. Now either we go here either the buyers 
take control. From what I'm seeing, we go here. Why aggressive buyers? No followup. Yep. Like if 
you want this can be a short but it's against the the bias. The bias. So we will not experience it 
and we will not try it. So we are waiting that 

03:01:08	the market gives us a new long position. Mhm. 
That of course is not providing at the moment. So would you need to uh see price 
close back above any certain level before looking to X? Yes, I will 
show you also which level. Now the consolidation era is still the same. 
Okay, let's remove for a second the big trades and let's go on what really matters. Did it break 
the value area low? No. Did it break the value area high? Yes. Okay. First information. 
Now sellers are getting really aggressive 

03:01:52	here. What does it mean? Like before before 
skyrocketing the market up, it took the low. Okay. So either this candle is full of aggressive 
sellers. There is a big ball here. Either we go back here and I see market activity participant 
buy and I engage. Either we use the trend following setup only when it closed the candle 
here. You remember break testing here like we did here. This explosion was taken thanks to this. 
Okay. So we took a stop loss here. We don't want to engage in the noise now. Yeah. Just want to 
be patient about it. Let's see what cuz otherwise 

03:02:36	let's say you know we get involved now. we could 
easily continue lower or even if we even if we close above this uh the top of the range there 
could still go lower while if we break above then we could have a high prob low probability that 
you will go lower and also consider that if it breaks higher you have a really clear level where 
to cover yourself. So you either you are right, either you are wrong really really fast here you 
can try along here get stopped out try again here get stopped out here if it breaks and it comes 
back is not valid anymore. Yeah you cannot get 

03:03:11	stopped out for no reason. So this could you going 
back to your analogy as well about you know during the battle this is essentially like during the 
battle here where we entered the trade that we just got stopped out on was when we had exited the 
battle. Mhm. Then it ended up being a loss. That's fine. Yes. It's part of trading, but now we're in 
the battle again. So, we're not looking to make a decision now. No, we want to come away from it. 
Exactly. But it's planned ahead of time. Yes. Now, at the moment, sellers are willing this battle. 
If sellers are willing to win this battle, 

03:03:45	this one needs to close. If this one needs to 
close, then we'll squeeze down. Uh we will do the opposite. We'll squeeze down. See aggressive 
sellers here jumping back liquidating all these ones and from here we can get the big buy movement 
of the day. Yeah, let's see how it behaves. Still didn't took the low. The squeeze happens when you 
took the low here and they have one, two, three, four, five low to revisit. Let's see how they will 
behave. Would you say usually What time are we into the open? We're couple hours in. Yes. Couple 
hours in the open. At this stage normally is there 

03:04:25	more volatility would you say or is this not like 
it's you see compression day first movement we made profit. Yeah. Then we lost in compression. 
As I told you the model don't work properly when there is compression. Mhm. Why we are still in 
profit if we took one take profit and one loss for only one reason our risk management. Yeah. We 
took profit when is necessary. We are wrong. When we are wrong we are wrong immediately. You see the 
squeeze like took the first low accelerated to the second. If accelerate to the second, it accelerate 
to the third. Big liquidation, fill the low volume 

03:04:58	node. Market makers don't like when the exchange 
is not um transaction properly. They don't like to void here. Okay. So you can see them from the 
low volume uh node and usually they get filled. So this cell if we were ignoring all of this this 
cell is saying sellers are getting aggressive but they are not having a follow through. Yeah. But in 
this situation we are also having a fail auction. If here we have a breakout of the candle and we 
get back here this could be a trade. Yeah. Is not the situation because also the buyers are 
not willing. So we are in the situation if you 

03:05:34	remember of the London session that we saw not 
clear direction not clear breakout long-term bias is clear is long but not a good setup to 
to take. Yeah let's remove the big trades here. Let's watch what's happen. So they took the 
first two loss, they get back inside in the sellers are still aggressive here. We didn't 
reach the value area low and we failed the auction here. Now let's clean everything. If we 
clean everything, we see something really clear this failed option. But at the same time, and 
I need to go on five minutes to show you this, 

03:06:30	the bias is clear. But look 
at this this situation. They didn't even revisit from the first 
trade that we took the balance area. So what can we do now? We can use the full impulse to time the delta and what we see we go deep inside the by delta that is more relevant is 
concentrated here in this three point 

03:07:14	one two and three these are the biggest one 
even if it's a void and this coherent with the test of this now if we get back here 
we have aggressive buyers we have sellers that are in deep loss yeah that can close 
the position and skyrocket up so from this situation I expect that shortterm the bias is 
still long we can accelerate and this exactly what we are doing so now it's time to take some 
of those previous lows that you mentioned we are going to take them. It's not worthy to 
take a long here against the momentum. Yeah, 

03:07:57	the narrative is really clear. The squeeze is 
happening. They took the first three low. They are going to target this other one. When 
they do it, they rebalance the low volume node. When they rebalance the low volume 
node, we have our opportunity to take a $500 trade. Yeah. To 2,000 profit, 3,000 
profit for the day. And we are done. Let's see. Now we can put now that it's moving. You see 
really aggressive accelerating to our accepted. Now I will never dream about putting the 
buy here without seeing some absorption 

03:08:45	or some aggressive buyers stepping in. 
Yeah. Like I will before wait this one is a continuation model like sellers 
aggressive buyers trying you want them to fail. You want them to like 
it's accelerating still pushing low. when it's uh yellow it's irrelevant like it's not 
relevant volume okay so it's below the threshold okay then uh you can point it out I think we are 
going to yes we are going to push it out till this Mhm. If these traders close the position, 
skyrocket up, we are experience the first time 

03:09:28	that we are seeing this now. Yeah. What risks 
can can we take here? If let me show you this is the candle that incorporated all this sell 
volume inside. If they manage to break the high of this candle, okay, and get back in, not 
even if I calculated on purpose, $500 risk, we can shoot up to $2,000 trade. It's a one to four riskto-reward. We will see later if it is still what we need 
to have to activate this setup break out with 

03:10:09	full body candle of this high. Okay. So you 
need to close. I need to close. Yes. So if the market goes down great aggressive 
cell I recalibrate my stop loss. Okay. Let's see what it does. Still I expect a whipso down. Why the buyers 
follow through is garbage. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um the sellers Yes. The sellers can push out 
up closing this position but the reaction of the buyers is not so good. If we start to 
go above here the sellers will be forced to 

03:10:50	close. This can be a catalyst for up. But I 
would like to see that we reach this global node. This is really interesting. Let's see 
if we manage to get it. Just so you know, you hold the record for the longest char episode. 
Really? That's right. Probably approaching four or five hours, I think, by now. Really? It's 
a course. It's not a Yeah, exactly. Exactly. We told the people free education, you know, 
that you've never seen before. And, you know, we like to deliver and you've helped us to 
do that. Like I said, I'm excited to see the 

03:11:24	feedback, the comments from everyone. Interesting. 
Interesting. Ultra aggressive sellers getting absorbed close to the low volume node. So this 
trade is not valid. Okay, we are canceling it. Now this low volume node is created by this 
candle. Mhm. And they try to create a new low but it failed to do it. So we expect that 
if we approach again this low we have the final drive when the bubbles present 
themselves on the chart is that when the execution has taken yes okay exactly 
so you expect so especially for that size 

03:12:07	you would expect price when it's happened 
to to instantly move really so the fact it doesn't is where we're saying absorption 
yes exactly because if we look back here for example those buys came in we moved Yes. Yeah. 
Same here. The sells came in, we didn't move, but the buys came in. We Yes. They they are 
facilitated in moving the the market. We are What about now? What is your We are getting ready 
for I need only the lock in of uh uh green. Here we are approaching the level. So, I'm 
waiting. You still need that closer. 

03:12:46	Yes. This is exactly $500. Let's put 
for now at 1,000. Let's see the close. The close is there. Not yet. It's a one minute 
candle. You needed to close above. Yeah, it can close also below this one. If it close 
the important is that it close below this, above this and above this. So, still not doing 
it. You see it's rejecting. Okay. This one is not okay. Still not in the trade. Gotcha. Thanks 
God. Still not in the trade because as soon as the sellers are not are still protecting the 
position, you will see the retracement. How 

03:13:30	often do you see like early buyers early sellers 
as in traps essentially or like okay getting in buyers early here for example. Mhm. But then 
we go to that low volume. Yeah. A lot of times does that happen a lot? Yeah. Yes. That's why 
that confirmation is so important. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a semaphore like if it's red and 
you are trying to pass two times out of 10 it's working but the other time you are 
crashing another car like now it's again presenting the setups but you needed to close 
I need to close but I think we are almost there 

03:14:06	let's see yes closed okay we are in just tested So, we got filled. Now, we can decide 
to scale one to two. Yeah. At 1,00 and then scale the final position out of the top of the day. If 
we take a stop loss on this one, we will close the day because the model is not responding properly 
because we are in consolidation phase. You see, we are whipsome whips. So, we protect the profit 
that we made for the day. Yeah. Now I like these setups because they are usually zero draw down 
like we are getting the whips. So up we are loaded 

03:14:47	here. When can we put this position to break even? 
Break this high we are risk free. Yeah let's see how it goes. You notice something about the really 
good setups that they go immediately in profit. That's the reason this one I decided to 
close only with $250 loss because if it fail to option I you are going to stop loss. 
There is no way you will win a trade like this. So we are in line with bias. We have aggressive 
sellers stopped absorbed not tapping directly on the low volume node but on the same level where 
the sellers get get absorbed before. Yeah, bias is 

03:15:33	there. Let's see if they reach at least the close. 
No, because it was over overlapped with this one. Imagine now they spike down. Close this one and 
stop this. That happens, right? Yeah, this will not surprise me. NASDAQ a lot of time does double 
legs with multiple spikes before jumping. But the good part about NASDAQ that now is not a good day. 
like we are managing to make profit but this is the worst day that you can have because usually 
when it's building momentum is trend falling this one is breakout we saw break out if we if we 
weren't in this saying right now where we're 

03:16:14	trying to obviously trade live and and continue to 
trade if you were at home and you took that first trade and you see this would you then okay it's a 
day for me or would you say when I see that this model fails goes back and I take profit from this 
probably I will just take another thousand profit and close for the day because it's not the market 
environment that is making me money. Yeah. Like I want to go more aggressive when it's like long 
session was really nice. You see uh directional move a lot of volatility in explosion like fast 
one to three setups now is getting like also for 

03:16:52	price action trader is getting really compressed. 
Yeah. like all this area is not making anything just breaking going down breaking going down. So 
now we have two scenario either we get another 1,000 profit and we close at 1,750 or we just 
get at least to break even this one when we break this high and we let it run. Yeah. If you let it 
run each contract that we open on this one Mhm. would give us. Let's go to the top of the day. For each contract we are making 3,680. 

03:17:37	So sometimes it's worth it to do it because if 
you get three or four contract you can make five figures per day. Yeah. But the win rate gets uh 
lower. So you can have these amazing days if you are heavy on the lot size like me. I I can open 
five, six, seven, 10 uh of mini contract. It's heavy. If you get 10 contract there, you can make 
$40,000. Uh but the win rate drops drops down. I This is just a personal like decision. I prefer 
a lot of days of 3,000 5,000 6,000 2,000 5,000 8,000 and to build the five to six figures for 
the month than having 40,000 minus 3 - 5 - 4 - 3 

03:18:23	is not psychologically is not um helping me you 
know and I think it's only ego because you can just take for example let's say that you are 
sometimes what happens is it always balance sometimes it balances Anyway, yeah, but one person 
hasn't had to take so many losses. Yeah. Which is, as you say, psychologically, most people 
couldn't handle that. There are going to be those occasional psychopaths who can handle 
handle in the beginning. Then I had one day where I was floating 28,000 for the day. I decided 
to keep for the eye. It just reversed five 

03:18:56	tick below the eye and I lost everything plus a 
stop loss on the next trades. So just I say, "No, it's just stupid. just you can close at 28,000 
you are done for the week what you need to do so it's heavier from the psychology side it's 
I will say also less profitable but I I don't know because I never try to keep my position 
open but for example today you will be already in true loss if you keep the stop loss there you 
don't trail or you don't manage we would already taken three loss mhm we will not be sitting 
on a profit now soon we go to break even on 

03:19:34	this one because it's going really good. We we got 
inside here on the test. When we reach the high, are you expecting a squeeze with this three? Yes. 
Okay. That's the reason that I I say I will bring to break even not close full position here because 
with the right squeeze it can go really fast to for example 2,000. Okay. Can go really fast. So 
let's take as a reference that we bring to break even here. But what we can expect is momentum. Now 
building for the day and when does your typically your session come to an end? It depends like 
uh some session consider that I'm living in 

03:20:13	uh United Arab Emirates. So I'm uh for me 
New York session is uh really late. Yeah, it's already uh 7. Yeah, 7 and um usually I finish 
8 9 sometimes 10. And it's not just convenient to keep. So I do the first three to four hours of 
the session. Yeah. And I just manage trades but I don't decide not to take other trades. Now we have 
um an opportunity to put our stop loss to break even already. If this break again this eye not to 
break even to stop no to break even to break even. If this eye breaks what the market is saying to us 
is that aggressive buyers are pushing sellers are 

03:20:58	trying to get aggressive. but they are getting 
failed. You know, I will not even say to break even, but I will secure other $250. So, putting 
stopping profit. So, in the worst case scenario, we close $1,000 and I'm still okay with it, you 
know. Let's see if it approached the high and get as Yes. So, yes, exactly $250 for the day. 
Um, that brings back back like if we didn't took the previous loss. Yeah. And uh you see 
building slowly the profit for the day is not heavy mentally and is not giving us the risk 
that if now this is a failed auction that it 

03:21:35	explode lower we get another $500 loss. Yeah. 
Like getting consistent wins getting all your trading journal green it's better than getting 
green on one day and red on all the other days. What happens if uh is that what you would expect 
though if price was to come to this level to go continue lower down to here? Considering that it's 
not breaking if it goes back here and it breaks. Yes. It will go at least to break even. Yeah. To 
to the previous level where we entered. So then you might as well put it into profit. Better be 
out. Better be out. like securing uh securing some 

03:22:09	profit for the day and uh be able to make 1,000 in 
the worst market environment. Secure for you five or 10,000 when the condition are good. Yeah. Like 
look at this market. The only trending environment that we did is this one and we monetized it. 
Exactly. All the rest is just managing your risk management and surviving this market condition. I 
decided to put that stopping profit here because this failed option. Yeah. Says a lot about what 
the price want to do. Okay. Says a lot. So if we break this one, we will collapse down and then 
you can say maybe we react here. Yes. We can try 

03:22:50	another trade but sitting on a profit. Yeah. Like 
we can risk the profit. Yeah. And if it does come down though to the low volume node for example, 
then you have then you you can use half of the 1,000 that we make. Yeah. for uh for for it but 
just I know NASDAQ and I know that after the huge gap that it made usually the day is rebalance you 
know because the yeah it's it's a really not clear situation about Iran and they are just compressing 
you see also the buyers are not getting any followup like they are trying to push in the 
market high but it was getting really aggressive 

03:23:30	by the sellers we are still not out of the 
position Let's see if this buyer can protect it. Consider that the profit that we made today is 
made considering one contract execution. Yeah. So you need to multiply it for the amount 
of margin you have available to open three, four, five contract. We are out. We are 
1,000 in profit for the day. We are out. Now what we can do again is if this breaks 
the high try the squeeze. Okay. From here but it needs to break the high. You need a close 
again. Yes. Yeah. Squeeze the from here. Getting 

03:24:22	$1,000 profit. I think we can reach this 
easily if the price squeeze correctly. Mhm. So now we are 1,000 another 1,000 per 
contract. Consider that with five contract available you will close the day at 10,000. 
Yeah. People don't consider how much profit it is. But if you can do this in these 
days, this candle close we are in. Mhm. You can also get a little bit more aggressive. 
For example, this one it's $290 each contract. You can get two contract and get 600 risk 
to make other 2,000. Yeah. Yeah. Now we are 

03:25:02	making all the trades with one contract. So we 
just consider one contract. We need to be with a candle out of this area. Yeah. For confirming 
trades. Still no. Did you ever in the beginning when when looking at charts in this way when 
price got above just enter without the closure? I that's the reason now I'm so calm. What would 
you say helped you to overcome that? Uh the equity line. The equity line. You see this one is not 
accepting is didn't close. Now this is the first candle that can close above and we need to adapt. 
Like if the candle for example is closing here, 

03:25:46	it's still valid but we need to take other $100 
of risk. Okay. So we just need a candle that close. At the moment is not closing. And every 
time that you reject, as I told you, the setup gets weaker and weaker. So every time I get more 
um demanding from my setup. So for example, now I expect for a breakout of this. Mhm. So I need 
a breakout of this level. I will take still $385 to target for I think what you said is 
right though in terms of uh the day the day that we're trading today with obviously 
that large gap that is a large gap as well. 

03:26:22	3% um of a gap that got reclaimed and then we 
did have some decent movement after that reclaim as well in London right um as well as coming into 
New York we had a very good move that we captured as well so you know in reality we could have this 
move but we could also just chop and chop probably for the way this presenting like breaking the high 
of the consolidation and getting in this chop It's a decision day and it's Monday. Yeah, it's really 
common. Yeah, Monday that it happens like Monday and Friday are my worst day in performance. Yeah, 
because they are not explosion day. They are I 

03:27:03	still make profit but the profit factor is like 
way lower. Mhm. But um if it breaks there you see again fake breakout getting back inside we are 
just not doing anything just compressing the only thing that I can expect is that if we approach 
this high we see some acceleration that's the reason I still say I can also take double the risk 
here and risk $700 if it goes in the worst case scenario I'm still in profit for the day small 
profit but I'm profitable for the day. Yeah. And if you take double the risk, it's another 2,000 
that this will bring the day to 3,000. Now let's 

03:27:41	consider we take this trade and we close the 
day at 3,000. We are using one contract. Okay, let's see also to contract is what you can do 
with 100,000 $100,000 account. Yeah, it's 3% in one day. People don't understand how much it 
is if you can do this consistently. Of course, like the edge found will be craving for you 
like we will be knocking on your door. It's a good accumulation what he's doing here. This 
is a good pattern taking the low rejecting on the big trades. This is really nice. So really 
when it comes to the the big buyers and sellers, 

03:28:16	for example, if a seller stepped in right now 
but no follow through, that's great for that narrative. If a buyer steps in right now with 
follow through, that's great for the narrative. Uh what you don't want to see is a seller step 
in and it follows through or a buyer follow uh fail. Yes. If you are long. Yes. Yeah. Opposite 
if you are short like we were seeing of course see again fake breakouts times with the rules that I 
created that you need to see a full body candle above the eye. You are saving all these small 
stops. Yeah. Because you are not engaging. You 

03:28:50	are simply not engaging. I told you NASDAQ is 
not uncommon that it will Mhm. do this gain. If it got down there now though, at this point in 
the session, would you still be interested in it or? I would. It would be an amazing trades, 
but it means that I need to sacrifice time with uh with my family and I need to not eat because 
I need to manage the trades. It's really late now for for me. I will take it, but I will bring 
it to break even as soon as possible. And this is the only set and forget trades that I will do. And 
then yeah because this testing of this I go break 

03:29:27	even at the first big volume and then if it reach 
the eyes or if u I need to close it uh before the end of the day I just don't care. Yeah just I 
need to be protected as soon as possible but I need also to protect my mental health. Yeah, this 
is something that people are willing to sacrifice just to make additional 50 bucks per day or 
additional I'm not willing to do it because I am already in a position where money it's not 
important for me and 1,000 plus per day doesn't change my life. Yeah. So I can decide when to 
engage and where not to engage. For example, 

03:30:02	now now we are doing education but this day I will 
say 1,000 it's enough. Tomorrow it's another day and I will wait for the explosion day. I was like 
this is the goal of every trader. If you can make money or just close at break even in the days 
that your model is not working. So for example, you have a min reverting day and you have a 
trending day, you close break even a small profit, you're great. Yeah. Same for trend 
following model. Whilst we're waiting on this, if we go down just out of curiosity and I'm sure 
there might be some who are might be thinking this 

03:30:36	or asking this. 5 minutes or 1 minute? Uh we stay 
one minute. If we come down to that level where we rebounded off ah yes this one like there will be 
people no doubt thinking like why not why don't we try and execute there because that's going to give 
us such a larger trade right and I know we talked about it slightly earlier but like what would your 
what would your opinion on that be because um this setup here is using the opposite logic that I'm 
using is using one big run with lower rate. Yeah. Like I can guarantee to you that if you watch 
NASDAQ session opening seven times out of 10 if 

03:31:16	you try to get the aggression you will fail. Three 
times out of 10 you will be right and you will you will take a huge risk to reward trades. But you 
have seven red days and three green days and you don't know when they're presented. If this is okay 
for you do it like volume is greater because it's saying that these sellers are getting absorbed. 
Just I tried this model and it's not for me. Like when you trade big sides getting 7 days strict 
loss that you see - 10,000 - 5 - 6 it's heavy go to sleep with this heaviness is for me it's not 
I I see before I was searching for the home run 

03:31:57	you know I was wanting to take you see it break 
the Mhm. the session. So this setup of getting the full candle positioning yourself is not valid 
anymore. This market condition is in reverting. Yeah. So just going to revisit and this should let 
people understand that taking out here is saving you money. Yeah. Mhm. Like and if we kept the 
trade till here, we didn't only not profit this $250, but we will also lose $500. So, as 
you can see, and we can demonstrate this, risk management is if not more important at the 
same level, cuz keep in mind as well that was 

03:32:42	with one contract. So, if it was more, if it was 
more it was 7,500. If it was 10 more, at the end of the month, it count. Now the we are completely 
compressing. Let's see if we accelerate a little bit to get to this final point. If not and call it 
a day there because it's been incredible. If not, we got to see everything though. We got to see 
break even. We got to see four hours of I know. Yeah. Yeah. I think we will just close the day 
because it's full consolidation rits. Yeah. And uh we'll just check later how it went. If it closed 
the low volume node and went up. Yeah. Yeah, 

03:33:22	we'll get a screenshot or something going for
